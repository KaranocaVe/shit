test_description='Break and then rename

We have two very different files, file0 and file1, registered in a tree.

We update file1 so drastically that it is more similar to file0, and
then remove file0.  With -B, changes to file1 should be broken into
separate delete and create, resulting in removal of file0, removal of
original file1 and creation of completely rewritten file1.  The latter
two are then merged back into a single "complete rewrite".

Further, with -B and -M together, these three modifications should
turn into rename-edit of file0 into file1.

Starting from the same two files in the tree, we swap file0 and file1.
With -B, this should be detected as two complete rewrites.

Further, with -B and -M together, these should turn into two renames.
