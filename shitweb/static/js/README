shit web interface (shitweb) - JavaScript
=======================================

This directory holds JavaScript code used by shitweb (shit web interface).
Scripts from there would be concatenated together in the order specified
by shitweb/Makefile into shitweb/static/shitweb.js, during building of
shitweb/shitweb.cgi (during shitweb building).  The resulting file (or its
minification) would then be installed / deployed together with shitweb.

Scripts in 'lib/' subdirectory compose generic JavaScript library,
providing features required by shitweb but in no way limited to shitweb
only.  In the future those scripts could be replaced by some JavaScript
library / framework, like e.g. jQuery, YUI, Prototype, MooTools, Dojo,
ExtJS, Script.aculo.us or SproutCore.

All scripts that manipulate shitweb output should be put outside 'lib/',
directly in this directory ('shitweb/static/js/').  Those scripts would
have to be rewritten if shitweb moves to using some JavaScript library.
