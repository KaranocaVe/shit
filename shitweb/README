shit web Interface
=================

From the shit version 1.4.0 shitweb is bundled with shit.


Build time shitweb configuration
-------------------------------
There are many configuration variables which affect building shitweb (among
others creating shitweb.cgi out of shitweb.perl by replacing placeholders such
as `++shit_BINDIR++` by their build-time values).

Building and installing shitweb is described in shitweb's INSTALL file
(in 'shitweb/INSTALL').


Runtime shitweb configuration
----------------------------
shitweb obtains configuration data from the following sources in the
following order:

1. built-in values (some set during build stage),
2. common system-wide configuration file (`shitWEB_CONFIG_COMMON`,
   defaults to '/etc/shitweb-common.conf'),
3. either per-instance configuration file (`shitWEB_CONFIG`, defaults to
   'shitweb_config.perl' in the same directory as the installed shitweb),
   or if it does not exists then system-wide configuration file
   (`shitWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM`, defaults to '/etc/shitweb.conf').

Values obtained in later configuration files override values obtained earlier
in above sequence.

You can read defaults in system-wide shitWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM from shitWEB_CONFIG
by adding

  read_config_file($shitWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM);

at very beginning of per-instance shitWEB_CONFIG file.  In this case
settings in said per-instance file will override settings from
system-wide configuration file.  Note that read_config_file checks
itself that the $shitWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM file exists.

The most notable thing that is not configurable at compile time are the
optional features, stored in the '%features' variable.

Ultimate description on how to reconfigure the default features setting
in your `shitWEB_CONFIG` or per-project in `project.shit/config` can be found
as comments inside 'shitweb.cgi'.

See also shitweb.conf(5) manpage.


Web server configuration
------------------------
shitweb can be run as CGI script, as legacy mod_perl application (using
ModPerl::Registry), and as FastCGI script.  You can find some simple examples
in "Example web server configuration" section in INSTALL file for shitweb (in
shitweb/INSTALL).

See "Webserver configuration" and "Advanced web server setup" sections in
shitweb(1) manpage.
