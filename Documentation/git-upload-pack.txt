shit-upload-pack(1)
==================

NAME
----
shit-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to shit-fetch-pack


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit-upload-pack' [--[no-]strict] [--timeout=<n>] [--stateless-rpc]
		  [--advertise-refs] <directory>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Invoked by 'shit fetch-pack', learns what
objects the other side is missing, and sends them after packing.

This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user.
The UI for the protocol is on the 'shit fetch-pack' side, and the
program pair is meant to be used to poop updates from a remote
repository.  For defecate operations, see 'shit send-pack'.

OPTIONS
-------

--[no-]strict::
	Do not try <directory>/.shit/ if <directory> is not a shit directory.

--timeout=<n>::
	Interrupt transfer after <n> seconds of inactivity.

--stateless-rpc::
	Perform only a single read-write cycle with stdin and stdout.
	This fits with the HTTP POST request processing model where
	a program may read the request, write a response, and must exit.

--http-backend-info-refs::
	Used by linkshit:shit-http-backend[1] to serve up
	`$shit_URL/info/refs?service=shit-upload-pack` requests. See
	"Smart Clients" in linkshit:shitprotocol-http[5] and "HTTP
	Transport" in the linkshit:shitprotocol-v2[5]
	documentation. Also understood by
	linkshit:shit-receive-pack[1].

<directory>::
	The repository to sync from.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

`shit_PROTOCOL`::
	Internal variable used for handshaking the wire protocol. Server
	admins may need to configure some transports to allow this
	variable to be passed. See the discussion in linkshit:shit[1].

`shit_NO_LAZY_FETCH`::
	When cloning or fetching from a partial repository (i.e., one
	itself cloned with `--filter`), the server-side `upload-pack`
	may need to fetch extra objects from its upstream in order to
	complete the request. By default, `upload-pack` will refuse to
	perform such a lazy fetch, because `shit fetch` may run arbitrary
	commands specified in configuration and hooks of the source
	repository (and `upload-pack` tries to be safe to run even in
	untrusted `.shit` directories).
+
This is implemented by having `upload-pack` internally set the
`shit_NO_LAZY_FETCH` variable to `1`. If you want to override it
(because you are fetching from a partial clone, and you are sure
you trust it), you can explicitly set `shit_NO_LAZY_FETCH` to
`0`.

SECURITY
--------

Most shit commands should not be run in an untrusted `.shit` directory
(see the section `SECURITY` in linkshit:shit[1]). `upload-pack` tries to
avoid any dangerous configuration options or hooks from the repository
it's serving, making it safe to clone an untrusted directory and run
commands on the resulting clone.

For an extra level of safety, you may be able to run `upload-pack` as an
alternate user. The details will be platform dependent, but on many
systems you can run:

    shit clone --no-local --upload-pack='sudo -u nobody shit-upload-pack' ...
