shit-whatchanged(1)
==================

NAME
----
shit-whatchanged - Show logs with differences each commit introduces


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit whatchanged' <option>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.

New users are encouraged to use linkshit:shit-log[1] instead.  The
`whatchanged` command is essentially the same as linkshit:shit-log[1]
but defaults to showing the raw format diff output and skipping merges.

The command is primarily kept for historical reasons; fingers of
many people who learned shit long before `shit log` was invented by
reading the Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.


Examples
--------
`shit whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi`::

	Show as patches the commits since version 'v2.6.12' that changed
	any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi subdirectories

`shit whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago" -- shitk`::

	Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file 'shitk'.
	The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the *branch* named
	'shitk'
