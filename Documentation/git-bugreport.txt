NAME
----
shit-bugreport - Collect information for user to file a bug report

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit bugreport' [(-o | --output-directory) <path>]
		[(-s | --suffix) <format> | --no-suffix]
		[--diagnose[=<mode>]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Collects information about the user's machine, shit client, and repository
state, in addition to a form requesting information about the behavior the
user observed, and stores it in a single text file which the user can then
share, for example to the shit mailing list, in order to report an observed
bug.

The following information is requested from the user:

 - Reproduction steps
 - Expected behavior
 - Actual behavior

The following information is captured automatically:

 - 'shit version --build-options'
 - uname sysname, release, version, and machine strings
 - Compiler-specific info string
 - A list of enabled hooks
 - $SHELL

Additional information may be gathered into a separate zip archive using the
`--diagnose` option, and can be attached alongside the bugreport document to
provide additional context to readers.

This tool is invoked via the typical shit setup process, which means that in some
cases, it might not be able to launch - for example, if a relevant config file
is unreadable. In this kind of scenario, it may be helpful to manually gather
the kind of information listed above when manually asking for help.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <path>::
--output-directory <path>::
	Place the resulting bug report file in `<path>` instead of the current
	directory.

-s <format>::
--suffix <format>::
--no-suffix::
	Specify an alternate suffix for the bugreport name, to create a file
	named 'shit-bugreport-<formatted-suffix>'. This should take the form of a
	strftime(3) format string; the current local time will be used.
	`--no-suffix` disables the suffix and the file is just named
	`shit-bugreport` without any disambiguation measure.

--no-diagnose::
--diagnose[=<mode>]::
	Create a zip archive of supplemental information about the user's
	machine, shit client, and repository state. The archive is written to the
	same output directory as the bug report and is named
	'shit-diagnostics-<formatted-suffix>'.
+
Without `mode` specified, the diagnostic archive will contain the default set of
statistics reported by `shit diagnose`. An optional `mode` value may be specified
to change which information is included in the archive. See
linkshit:shit-diagnose[1] for the list of valid values for `mode` and details
about their usage.
