NAME
----
shitrevisions - Specifying revisions and ranges for shit

SYNOPSIS
--------
shitrevisions


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Many shit commands take revision parameters as arguments. Depending on
the command, they denote a specific commit or, for commands which
walk the revision graph (such as linkshit:shit-log[1]), all commits which are
reachable from that commit. For commands that walk the revision graph one can
also specify a range of revisions explicitly.

In addition, some shit commands (such as linkshit:shit-show[1] and
linkshit:shit-defecate[1]) can also take revision parameters which denote
other objects than commits, e.g. blobs ("files") or trees
("directories of files").
