i18n.commitEncoding::
	Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; shit itself
	does not care per se, but this information is necessary e.g. when
	importing commits from emails or in the shitk graphical history
	browser (and possibly in other places in the future or in other
	porcelains). See e.g. linkshit:shit-mailinfo[1]. Defaults to 'utf-8'.

i18n.logOutputEncoding::
	Character encoding the commit messages are converted to when
	running 'shit log' and friends.
