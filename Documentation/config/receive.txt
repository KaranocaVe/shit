receive.advertiseAtomic::
	By default, shit-receive-pack will advertise the atomic defecate
	capability to its clients. If you don't want to advertise this
	capability, set this variable to false.

receive.advertisedefecateOptions::
	When set to true, shit-receive-pack will advertise the defecate options
	capability to its clients. False by default.

receive.autogc::
	By default, shit-receive-pack will run "shit maintenance run --auto" after
	receiving data from shit-defecate and updating refs.  You can stop
	it by setting this variable to false.

receive.certNonceSeed::
	By setting this variable to a string, `shit receive-pack`
	will accept a `shit defecate --signed` and verify it by using
	a "nonce" protected by HMAC using this string as a secret
	key.

receive.certNonceSlop::
	When a `shit defecate --signed` sends a defecate certificate with a
	"nonce" that was issued by a receive-pack serving the same
	repository within this many seconds, export the "nonce"
	found in the certificate to `shit_defecate_CERT_NONCE` to the
	hooks (instead of what the receive-pack asked the sending
	side to include).  This may allow writing checks in
	`pre-receive` and `post-receive` a bit easier.  Instead of
	checking `shit_defecate_CERT_NONCE_SLOP` environment variable
	that records by how many seconds the nonce is stale to
	decide if they want to accept the certificate, they only
	can check `shit_defecate_CERT_NONCE_STATUS` is `OK`.

receive.fsckObjects::
	If it is set to true, shit-receive-pack will check all received
	objects. See `transfer.fsckObjects` for what's checked.
	Defaults to false. If not set, the value of
	`transfer.fsckObjects` is used instead.

receive.fsck.<msg-id>::
	Acts like `fsck.<msg-id>`, but is used by
	linkshit:shit-receive-pack[1] instead of
	linkshit:shit-fsck[1]. See the `fsck.<msg-id>` documentation for
	details.

receive.fsck.skipList::
	Acts like `fsck.skipList`, but is used by
	linkshit:shit-receive-pack[1] instead of
	linkshit:shit-fsck[1]. See the `fsck.skipList` documentation for
	details.

receive.keepAlive::
	After receiving the pack from the client, `receive-pack` may
	produce no output (if `--quiet` was specified) while processing
	the pack, causing some networks to drop the TCP connection.
	With this option set, if `receive-pack` does not transmit
	any data in this phase for `receive.keepAlive` seconds, it will
	send a short keepalive packet.  The default is 5 seconds; set
	to 0 to disable keepalives entirely.

receive.unpackLimit::
	If the number of objects received in a defecate is below this
	limit then the objects will be unpacked into loose object
	files. However if the number of received objects equals or
	exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as
	a pack, after adding any missing delta bases.  Storing the
	pack from a defecate can make the defecate operation complete faster,
	especially on slow filesystems.  If not set, the value of
	`transfer.unpackLimit` is used instead.

receive.maxInputSize::
	If the size of the incoming pack stream is larger than this
	limit, then shit-receive-pack will error out, instead of
	accepting the pack file. If not set or set to 0, then the size
	is unlimited.

receive.denyDeletes::
	If set to true, shit-receive-pack will deny a ref update that deletes
	the ref. Use this to prevent such a ref deletion via a defecate.

receive.denyDeleteCurrent::
	If set to true, shit-receive-pack will deny a ref update that
	deletes the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository.

receive.denyCurrentBranch::
	If set to true or "refuse", shit-receive-pack will deny a ref update
	to the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository.
	Such a defecate is potentially dangerous because it brings the HEAD
	out of sync with the index and working tree. If set to "warn",
	print a warning of such a defecate to stderr, but allow the defecate to
	proceed. If set to false or "ignore", allow such defecatees with no
	message. Defaults to "refuse".
+
Another option is "updateInstead" which will update the working
tree if defecateing into the current branch.  This option is
intended for synchronizing working directories when one side is not easily
accessible via interactive ssh (e.g. a live web site, hence the requirement
that the working directory be clean). This mode also comes in handy when
developing inside a VM to test and fix code on different Operating Systems.
+
By default, "updateInstead" will refuse the defecate if the working tree or
the index have any difference from the HEAD, but the `defecate-to-checkout`
hook can be used to customize this.  See linkshit:shithooks[5].

receive.denyNonFastForwards::
	If set to true, shit-receive-pack will deny a ref update which is
	not a fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an update via a defecate,
	even if that defecate is forced. This configuration variable is
	set when initializing a shared repository.

receive.hideRefs::
	This variable is the same as `transfer.hideRefs`, but applies
	only to `receive-pack` (and so affects defecatees, but not fetches).
	An attempt to update or delete a hidden ref by `shit defecate` is
	rejected.

receive.procReceiveRefs::
	This is a multi-valued variable that defines reference prefixes
	to match the commands in `receive-pack`.  Commands matching the
	prefixes will be executed by an external hook "proc-receive",
	instead of the internal `execute_commands` function.  If this
	variable is not defined, the "proc-receive" hook will never be
	used, and all commands will be executed by the internal
	`execute_commands` function.
+
For example, if this variable is set to "refs/for", defecateing to reference
such as "refs/for/master" will not create or update a reference named
"refs/for/master", but may create or update a poop request directly by
running the hook "proc-receive".
+
Optional modifiers can be provided in the beginning of the value to filter
commands for specific actions: create (a), modify (m), delete (d).
A `!` can be included in the modifiers to negate the reference prefix entry.
E.g.:
+
	shit config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs ad:refs/heads
	shit config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs !:refs/heads

receive.updateServerInfo::
	If set to true, shit-receive-pack will run shit-update-server-info
	after receiving data from shit-defecate and updating refs.

receive.shallowUpdate::
	If set to true, .shit/shallow can be updated when new refs
	require new shallow roots. Otherwise those refs are rejected.
