	`branch.<name>.remote` for all branches, and is overridden by
	`branch.<name>.defecateRemote` for specific branches.

	The URL of a remote repository.  See linkshit:shit-fetch[1] or
	linkshit:shit-defecate[1].

	disable proxying for that remote.

remote.<name>.proxyAuthMethod::
	For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the method to use for
	authenticating against the proxy in use (probably set in
	`remote.<name>.proxy`). See `http.proxyAuthMethod`.

	The default set of "refspec" for linkshit:shit-fetch[1]. See
	linkshit:shit-fetch[1].

remote.<name>.defecate::
	The default set of "refspec" for linkshit:shit-defecate[1]. See

remote.<name>.mirror::
	If true, defecateing to this remote will automatically behave
	as if the `--mirror` option was given on the command line.

remote.<name>.skipDefaultUpdate::
	If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
	using linkshit:shit-fetch[1] or the `update` subcommand of
	linkshit:shit-remote[1].

remote.<name>.skipFetchAll::
	If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
	using linkshit:shit-fetch[1] or the `update` subcommand of

	option --upload-pack of linkshit:shit-fetch-pack[1].

remote.<name>.tagOpt::
	Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag following when

	override this setting. See options --tags and --no-tags of
	linkshit:shit-fetch[1].

remote.<name>.vcs::
	Setting this to a value <vcs> will cause shit to interact with
	the remote with the shit-remote-<vcs> helper.

remote.<name>.prune::
	When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will also
	remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the
	remote (as if the `--prune` option was given on the command line).
	Overrides `fetch.prune` settings, if any.

remote.<name>.pruneTags::
	When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will also
	remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote if pruning
	is activated in general via `remote.<name>.prune`, `fetch.prune` or
	`--prune`. Overrides `fetch.pruneTags` settings, if any.

See also `remote.<name>.prune` and the PRUNING section of

remote.<name>.promisor::
	When set to true, this remote will be used to fetch promisor

	To fetch associated objects for commits already present in the local object
	database, use the `--refetch` option of linkshit:shit-fetch[1].
