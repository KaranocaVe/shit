add.ignoreErrors::
add.ignore-errors (deprecated)::
	Tells 'shit add' to continue adding files when some files cannot be
	added due to indexing errors. Equivalent to the `--ignore-errors`
	option of linkshit:shit-add[1].  `add.ignore-errors` is deprecated,
	as it does not follow the usual naming convention for configuration
	variables.

add.interactive.useBuiltin::
	Unused configuration variable. Used in shit versions v2.25.0 to
	v2.36.0 to enable the built-in version of linkshit:shit-add[1]'s
	interactive mode, which then became the default in shit
	versions v2.37.0 to v2.39.0.
