user.name::
user.email::
author.name::
author.email::
committer.name::
committer.email::
	The `user.name` and `user.email` variables determine what ends
	up in the `author` and `committer` fields of commit
	objects.
	If you need the `author` or `committer` to be different, the
	`author.name`, `author.email`, `committer.name`, or
	`committer.email` variables can be set.
	All of these can be overridden by the `shit_AUTHOR_NAME`,
	`shit_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `shit_COMMITTER_NAME`,
	`shit_COMMITTER_EMAIL`, and `EMAIL` environment variables.
+
Note that the `name` forms of these variables conventionally refer to
some form of a personal name.  See linkshit:shit-commit[1] and the
environment variables section of linkshit:shit[1] for more information on
these settings and the `credential.username` option if you're looking
for authentication credentials instead.

user.useConfigOnly::
	Instruct shit to avoid trying to guess defaults for `user.email`
	and `user.name`, and instead retrieve the values only from the
	configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses
	and would like to use a different one for each repository, then
	with this configuration option set to `true` in the global config
	along with a name, shit will prompt you to set up an email before
	making new commits in a newly cloned repository.
	Defaults to `false`.

user.signingKey::
	If linkshit:shit-tag[1] or linkshit:shit-commit[1] is not selecting the
	key you want it to automatically when creating a signed tag or
	commit, you can override the default selection with this variable.
	This option is passed unchanged to gpg's --local-user parameter,
	so you may specify a key using any method that gpg supports.
	If gpg.format is set to `ssh` this can contain the path to either
	your private ssh key or the public key when ssh-agent is used.
	Alternatively it can contain a public key prefixed with `key::`
	directly (e.g.: "key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier"). The private key
	needs to be available via ssh-agent. If not set shit will call
	gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand (e.g.: "ssh-add -L") and try to use the
	first key available. For backward compatibility, a raw key which
	begins with "ssh-", such as "ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier", is treated
	as "key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier", but this form is deprecated;
	use the `key::` form instead.
