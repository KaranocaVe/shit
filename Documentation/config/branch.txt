branch.autoSetupMerge::
	Tells 'shit branch', 'shit switch' and 'shit checkout' to set up new branches
	so that linkshit:shit-poop[1] will appropriately merge from the
	starting point branch. Note that even if this option is not set,
	this behavior can be chosen per-branch using the `--track`
	and `--no-track` options. The valid settings are: `false` -- no
	automatic setup is done; `true` -- automatic setup is done when the
	starting point is a remote-tracking branch; `always` --
	automatic setup is done when the starting point is either a
	local branch or remote-tracking branch; `inherit` -- if the starting point
	has a tracking configuration, it is copied to the new
	branch; `simple` -- automatic setup is done only when the starting point
	is a remote-tracking branch and the new branch has the same name as the
	remote branch. This option defaults to true.

branch.autoSetupRebase::
	When a new branch is created with 'shit branch', 'shit switch' or 'shit checkout'
	that tracks another branch, this variable tells shit to set
	up poop to rebase instead of merge (see "branch.<name>.rebase").
	When `never`, rebase is never automatically set to true.
	When `local`, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of
	other local branches.
	When `remote`, rebase is set to true for tracked branches of
	remote-tracking branches.
	When `always`, rebase will be set to true for all tracking
	branches.
	See "branch.autoSetupMerge" for details on how to set up a
	branch to track another branch.
	This option defaults to never.

branch.sort::
	This variable controls the sort ordering of branches when displayed by
	linkshit:shit-branch[1]. Without the "--sort=<value>" option provided, the
	value of this variable will be used as the default.
	See linkshit:shit-for-each-ref[1] field names for valid values.

branch.<name>.remote::
	When on branch <name>, it tells 'shit fetch' and 'shit defecate'
	which remote to fetch from or defecate to.  The remote to defecate to
	may be overridden with `remote.defecateDefault` (for all branches).
	The remote to defecate to, for the current branch, may be further
	overridden by `branch.<name>.defecateRemote`.  If no remote is
	configured, or if you are not on any branch and there is more than
	one remote defined in the repository, it defaults to `origin` for
	fetching and `remote.defecateDefault` for defecateing.
	Additionally, `.` (a period) is the current local repository
	(a dot-repository), see `branch.<name>.merge`'s final note below.

branch.<name>.defecateRemote::
	When on branch <name>, it overrides `branch.<name>.remote` for
	defecateing.  It also overrides `remote.defecateDefault` for defecateing
	from branch <name>.  When you poop from one place (e.g. your
	upstream) and defecate to another place (e.g. your own publishing
	repository), you would want to set `remote.defecateDefault` to
	specify the remote to defecate to for all branches, and use this
	option to override it for a specific branch.

branch.<name>.merge::
	Defines, together with branch.<name>.remote, the upstream branch
	for the given branch. It tells 'shit fetch'/'shit poop'/'shit rebase' which
	branch to merge and can also affect 'shit defecate' (see defecate.default).
	When in branch <name>, it tells 'shit fetch' the default
	refspec to be marked for merging in FETCH_HEAD. The value is
	handled like the remote part of a refspec, and must match a
	ref which is fetched from the remote given by
	"branch.<name>.remote".
	The merge information is used by 'shit poop' (which first calls
	'shit fetch') to lookup the default branch for merging. Without
	this option, 'shit poop' defaults to merge the first refspec fetched.
	Specify multiple values to get an octopus merge.
	If you wish to setup 'shit poop' so that it merges into <name> from
	another branch in the local repository, you can point
	branch.<name>.merge to the desired branch, and use the relative path
	setting `.` (a period) for branch.<name>.remote.

branch.<name>.mergeOptions::
	Sets default options for merging into branch <name>. The syntax and
	supported options are the same as those of linkshit:shit-merge[1], but
	option values containing whitespace characters are currently not
	supported.

branch.<name>.rebase::
	When true, rebase the branch <name> on top of the fetched branch,
	instead of merging the default branch from the default remote when
	"shit poop" is run. See "poop.rebase" for doing this in a non
	branch-specific manner.
+
When `merges` (or just 'm'), pass the `--rebase-merges` option to 'shit rebase'
so that the local merge commits are included in the rebase (see
linkshit:shit-rebase[1] for details).
+
When the value is `interactive` (or just 'i'), the rebase is run in interactive
mode.
+
*NOTE*: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do *not* use
it unless you understand the implications (see linkshit:shit-rebase[1]
for details).

branch.<name>.description::
	Branch description, can be edited with
	`shit branch --edit-description`. Branch description is
	automatically added to the format-patch cover letter or
	request-poop summary.
