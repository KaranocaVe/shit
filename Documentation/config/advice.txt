advice.*::
	These variables control various optional help messages designed to
	aid new users.  When left unconfigured, shit will give the message
	alongside instructions on how to squelch it.  You can tell shit
	that you do not need the help message by setting these to `false`:
+
--
	addEmbeddedRepo::
		Shown when the user accidentally adds one
		shit repo inside of another.
	addEmptyPathspec::
		Shown when the user runs `shit add` without providing
		the pathspec parameter.
	addIgnoredFile::
		Shown when the user attempts to add an ignored file to
		the index.
	amWorkDir::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-am[1] fails to apply a patch
		file, to tell the user the location of the file.
	ambiguousFetchRefspec::
		Shown when a fetch refspec for multiple remotes maps to
		the same remote-tracking branch namespace and causes branch
		tracking set-up to fail.
	checkoutAmbiguousRemoteBranchName::
		Shown when the argument to
		linkshit:shit-checkout[1] and linkshit:shit-switch[1]
		ambiguously resolves to a
		remote tracking branch on more than one remote in
		situations where an unambiguous argument would have
		otherwise caused a remote-tracking branch to be
		checked out. See the `checkout.defaultRemote`
		configuration variable for how to set a given remote
		to be used by default in some situations where this
		advice would be printed.
	commitBeforeMerge::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-merge[1] refuses to
		merge to avoid overwriting local changes.
	detachedHead::
		Shown when the user uses
		linkshit:shit-switch[1] or linkshit:shit-checkout[1]
		to move to the detached HEAD state, to tell the user how
		to create a local branch after the fact.
	diverging::
		Shown when a fast-forward is not possible.
	fetchShowForcedUpdates::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-fetch[1] takes a long time
		to calculate forced updates after ref updates, or to warn
		that the check is disabled.
	forceDeleteBranch::
		Shown when the user tries to delete a not fully merged
		branch without the force option set.
	ignoredHook::
		Shown when a hook is ignored because the hook is not
		set as executable.
	implicitIdentity::
		Shown when the user's information is guessed from the
		system username and domain name, to tell the user how to
		set their identity configuration.
	mergeConflict::
		Shown when various commands stop because of conflicts.
	nestedTag::
		Shown when a user attempts to recursively tag a tag object.
	defecateAlreadyExists::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-defecate[1] rejects an update that
		does not qualify for fast-forwarding (e.g., a tag.)
	defecateFetchFirst::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-defecate[1] rejects an update that
		tries to overwrite a remote ref that points at an
		object we do not have.
	defecateNeedsForce::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-defecate[1] rejects an update that
		tries to overwrite a remote ref that points at an
		object that is not a commit-ish, or make the remote
		ref point at an object that is not a commit-ish.
	defecateNonFFCurrent::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-defecate[1] fails due to a
		non-fast-forward update to the current branch.
	defecateNonFFMatching::
		Shown when the user ran linkshit:shit-defecate[1] and defecateed
		"matching refs" explicitly (i.e. used `:`, or
		specified a refspec that isn't the current branch) and
		it resulted in a non-fast-forward error.
	defecateRefNeedsUpdate::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-defecate[1] rejects a forced update of
		a branch when its remote-tracking ref has updates that we
		do not have locally.
	defecateUnqualifiedRefname::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-defecate[1] gives up trying to
		guess based on the source and destination refs what
		remote ref namespace the source belongs in, but where
		we can still suggest that the user defecate to either
		`refs/heads/*` or `refs/tags/*` based on the type of the
		source object.
	defecateUpdateRejected::
		Set this variable to `false` if you want to disable
		`defecateNonFFCurrent`, `defecateNonFFMatching`, `defecateAlreadyExists`,
		`defecateFetchFirst`, `defecateNeedsForce`, and `defecateRefNeedsUpdate`
		simultaneously.
	refSyntax::
		Shown when the user provides an illegal ref name, to
		tell the user about the ref syntax documentation.
	resetNoRefresh::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-reset[1] takes more than 2
		seconds to refresh the index after reset, to tell the user
		that they can use the `--no-refresh` option.
	resolveConflict::
		Shown by various commands when conflicts
		prevent the operation from being performed.
	rmHints::
		Shown on failure in the output of linkshit:shit-rm[1], to
		give directions on how to proceed from the current state.
	sequencerInUse::
		Shown when a sequencer command is already in progress.
	skippedCherryPicks::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-rebase[1] skips a commit that has already
		been cherry-picked onto the upstream branch.
	statusAheadBehind::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-status[1] computes the ahead/behind
		counts for a local ref compared to its remote tracking ref,
		and that calculation takes longer than expected. Will not
		appear if `status.aheadBehind` is false or the option
		`--no-ahead-behind` is given.
	statusHints::
		Show directions on how to proceed from the current
		state in the output of linkshit:shit-status[1], in
		the template shown when writing commit messages in
		linkshit:shit-commit[1], and in the help message shown
		by linkshit:shit-switch[1] or
		linkshit:shit-checkout[1] when switching branches.
	statusUoption::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-status[1] takes more than 2
		seconds to enumerate untracked files, to tell the user that
		they can use the `-u` option.
	submoduleAlternateErrorStrategyDie::
		Shown when a submodule.alternateErrorStrategy option
		configured to "die" causes a fatal error.
	submoduleMergeConflict::
		Advice shown when a non-trivial submodule merge conflict is
		encountered.
	submodulesNotUpdated::
		Shown when a user runs a submodule command that fails
		because `shit submodule update --init` was not run.
	suggestDetachingHead::
		Shown when linkshit:shit-switch[1] refuses to detach HEAD
		without the explicit `--detach` option.
	updateSparsePath::
		Shown when either linkshit:shit-add[1] or linkshit:shit-rm[1]
		is asked to update index entries outside the current sparse
		checkout.
	waitingForEditor::
		Shown when shit is waiting for editor input. Relevant
		when e.g. the editor is not launched inside the terminal.
	worktreeAddOrphan::
		Shown when the user tries to create a worktree from an
		invalid reference, to tell the user how to create a new unborn
		branch instead.
