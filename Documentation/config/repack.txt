repack.useDeltaBaseOffset::
	By default, linkshit:shit-repack[1] creates packs that use
	delta-base offset. If you need to share your repository with
	shit older than version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb
	protocol such as http, then you need to set this option to
	"false" and repack. Access from old shit versions over the
	native protocol are unaffected by this option.

repack.packKeptObjects::
	If set to true, makes `shit repack` act as if
	`--pack-kept-objects` was passed. See linkshit:shit-repack[1] for
	details. Defaults to `false` normally, but `true` if a bitmap
	index is being written (either via `--write-bitmap-index` or
	`repack.writeBitmaps`).

repack.useDeltaIslands::
	If set to true, makes `shit repack` act as if `--delta-islands`
	was passed. Defaults to `false`.

repack.writeBitmaps::
	When true, shit will write a bitmap index when packing all
	objects to disk (e.g., when `shit repack -a` is run).  This
	index can speed up the "counting objects" phase of subsequent
	packs created for clones and fetches, at the cost of some disk
	space and extra time spent on the initial repack.  This has
	no effect if multiple packfiles are created.
	Defaults to true on bare repos, false otherwise.

repack.updateServerInfo::
	If set to false, linkshit:shit-repack[1] will not run
	linkshit:shit-update-server-info[1]. Defaults to true. Can be overridden
	when true by the `-n` option of linkshit:shit-repack[1].

repack.cruftWindow::
repack.cruftWindowMemory::
repack.cruftDepth::
repack.cruftThreads::
	Parameters used by linkshit:shit-pack-objects[1] when generating
	a cruft pack and the respective parameters are not given over
	the command line. See similarly named `pack.*` configuration
	variables for defaults and meaning.
