pretty.<name>::
	Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in
	linkshit:shit-log[1]. Any aliases defined here can be used just
	as the built-in pretty formats could. For example,
	running `shit config pretty.changelog "format:* %H %s"`
	would cause the invocation `shit log --pretty=changelog`
	to be equivalent to running `shit log "--pretty=format:* %H %s"`.
	Note that an alias with the same name as a built-in format
	will be silently ignored.
