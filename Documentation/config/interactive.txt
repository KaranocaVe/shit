interactive.singleKey::
	In interactive commands, allow the user to provide one-letter
	input with a single key (i.e., without hitting enter).
	Currently this is used by the `--patch` mode of
	linkshit:shit-add[1], linkshit:shit-checkout[1],
	linkshit:shit-restore[1], linkshit:shit-commit[1],
	linkshit:shit-reset[1], and linkshit:shit-stash[1].

interactive.diffFilter::
	When an interactive command (such as `shit add --patch`) shows
	a colorized diff, shit will pipe the diff through the shell
	command defined by this configuration variable. The command may
	mark up the diff further for human consumption, provided that it
	retains a one-to-one correspondence with the lines in the
	original diff. Defaults to disabled (no filtering).
