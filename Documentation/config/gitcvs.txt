shitcvs.commitMsgAnnotation::
	Append this string to each commit message. Set to empty string
	to disable this feature. Defaults to "via shit-CVS emulator".

shitcvs.enabled::
	Whether the CVS server interface is enabled for this repository.
	See linkshit:shit-cvsserver[1].

shitcvs.logFile::
	Path to a log file where the CVS server interface well... logs
	various stuff. See linkshit:shit-cvsserver[1].

shitcvs.usecrlfattr::
	If true, the server will look up the end-of-line conversion
	attributes for files to determine the `-k` modes to use. If
	the attributes force shit to treat a file as text,
	the `-k` mode will be left blank so CVS clients will
	treat it as text. If they suppress text conversion, the file
	will be set with '-kb' mode, which suppresses any newline munging
	the client might otherwise do. If the attributes do not allow
	the file type to be determined, then `shitcvs.allBinary` is
	used. See linkshit:shitattributes[5].

shitcvs.allBinary::
	This is used if `shitcvs.usecrlfattr` does not resolve
	the correct '-kb' mode to use. If true, all
	unresolved files are sent to the client in
	mode '-kb'. This causes the client to treat them
	as binary files, which suppresses any newline munging it
	otherwise might do. Alternatively, if it is set to "guess",
	then the contents of the file are examined to decide if
	it is binary, similar to `core.autocrlf`.

shitcvs.dbName::
	Database used by shit-cvsserver to cache revision information
	derived from the shit repository. The exact meaning depends on the
	used database driver, for SQLite (which is the default driver) this
	is a filename. Supports variable substitution (see
	linkshit:shit-cvsserver[1] for details). May not contain semicolons (`;`).
	Default: '%Gshitcvs.%m.sqlite'

shitcvs.dbDriver::
	Used Perl DBI driver. You can specify any available driver
	for this here, but it might not work. shit-cvsserver is tested
	with 'DBD::SQLite', reported to work with 'DBD::Pg', and
	reported *not* to work with 'DBD::mysql'. Experimental feature.
	May not contain double colons (`:`). Default: 'SQLite'.
	See linkshit:shit-cvsserver[1].

shitcvs.dbUser, shitcvs.dbPass::
	Database user and password. Only useful if setting `shitcvs.dbDriver`,
	since SQLite has no concept of database users and/or passwords.
	'shitcvs.dbUser' supports variable substitution (see
	linkshit:shit-cvsserver[1] for details).

shitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix::
	Database table name prefix.  Prepended to the names of any
	database tables used, allowing a single database to be used
	for several repositories.  Supports variable substitution (see
	linkshit:shit-cvsserver[1] for details).  Any non-alphabetic
	characters will be replaced with underscores.

All shitcvs variables except for `shitcvs.usecrlfattr` and
`shitcvs.allBinary` can also be specified as
'shitcvs.<access_method>.<varname>' (where 'access_method'
is one of "ext" and "pserver") to make them apply only for the given
access method.
