sequence.editor::
	Text editor used by `shit rebase -i` for editing the rebase instruction file.
	The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell when it is used.
	It can be overridden by the `shit_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` environment variable.
	When not configured, the default commit message editor is used instead.
