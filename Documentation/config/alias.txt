alias.*::
	Command aliases for the linkshit:shit[1] command wrapper - e.g.
	after defining `alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD`, the invocation
	`shit last` is equivalent to `shit cat-file commit HEAD`. To avoid
	confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that
	hide existing shit commands are ignored. Arguments are split by
	spaces, the usual shell quoting and escaping are supported.
	A quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote them.

Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be a
command. It can be a command-line option that will be passed into the
invocation of `shit`. In particular, this is useful when used with `-c`
to pass in one-time configurations or `-p` to force pagination. For example,
`loud-rebase = -c commit.verbose=true rebase` can be defined such that
running `shit loud-rebase` would be equivalent to
`shit -c commit.verbose=true rebase`. Also, `ps = -p status` would be a
helpful alias since `shit ps` would paginate the output of `shit status`
where the original command does not.
+
If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point,
it will be treated as a shell command.  For example, defining
`alias.new = !shitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD`, the invocation
`shit new` is equivalent to running the shell command
`shitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD`.  Note that shell commands will be
executed from the top-level directory of a repository, which may
not necessarily be the current directory.
`shit_PREFIX` is set as returned by running `shit rev-parse --show-prefix`
from the original current directory. See linkshit:shit-rev-parse[1].
