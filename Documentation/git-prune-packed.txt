shit-prune-packed(1)
===================

NAME
----
shit-prune-packed - Remove extra objects that are already in pack files


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit prune-packed' [-n | --dry-run] [-q | --quiet]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program searches the `$shit_OBJECT_DIRECTORY` for all objects that currently
exist in a pack file as well as in the independent object directories.

All such extra objects are removed.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta
compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines,
disk storage, etc.

--dry-run::
        Don't actually remove any objects, only show those that would have been
        removed.

-q::
--quiet::
	Squelch the progress indicator.
