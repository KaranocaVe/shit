DESCRIPTION
-----------
shit is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
and full access to internals.

See linkshit:shittutorial[7] to get started, then see
linkshit:shiteveryday[7] for a useful minimum set of
commands.  The link:user-manual.html[shit User's Manual] has a more
in-depth introduction.

After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this
page to learn what commands shit offers.  You can learn more about
individual shit commands with "shit help command".  linkshit:shitcli[7]
manual page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.

A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest shit documentation
can be viewed at https://shit.shithub.io/htmldocs/shit.html
or https://shit-scm.com/docs.


OPTIONS
-------
-v::
--version::
	Prints the shit suite version that the 'shit' program came from.
+
This option is internally converted to `shit version ...` and accepts
the same options as the linkshit:shit-version[1] command. If `--help` is
also given, it takes precedence over `--version`.

-h::
--help::
	Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used
	commands. If the option `--all` or `-a` is given then all
	available commands are printed. If a shit command is named this
	option will bring up the manual page for that command.
+
Other options are available to control how the manual page is
displayed. See linkshit:shit-help[1] for more information,
because `shit --help ...` is converted internally into `shit
help ...`.

-C <path>::
	Run as if shit was started in '<path>' instead of the current working
	directory.  When multiple `-C` options are given, each subsequent
	non-absolute `-C <path>` is interpreted relative to the preceding `-C
	<path>`.  If '<path>' is present but empty, e.g. `-C ""`, then the
	current working directory is left unchanged.
+
This option affects options that expect path name like `--shit-dir` and
`--work-tree` in that their interpretations of the path names would be
made relative to the working directory caused by the `-C` option. For
example the following invocations are equivalent:

    shit --shit-dir=a.shit --work-tree=b -C c status
    shit --shit-dir=c/a.shit --work-tree=c/b status

-c <name>=<value>::
	Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value
	given will override values from configuration files.
	The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by
	'shit config' (subkeys separated by dots).
+
Note that omitting the `=` in `shit -c foo.bar ...` is allowed and sets
`foo.bar` to the boolean true value (just like `[foo]bar` would in a
config file). Including the equals but with an empty value (like `shit -c
foo.bar= ...`) sets `foo.bar` to the empty string which `shit config
--type=bool` will convert to `false`.

--config-env=<name>=<envvar>::
	Like `-c <name>=<value>`, give configuration variable
	'<name>' a value, where <envvar> is the name of an
	environment variable from which to retrieve the value. Unlike
	`-c` there is no shortcut for directly setting the value to an
	empty string, instead the environment variable itself must be
	set to the empty string.  It is an error if the `<envvar>` does not exist
	in the environment. `<envvar>` may not contain an equals sign
	to avoid ambiguity with `<name>` containing one.
+
This is useful for cases where you want to pass transitory
configuration options to shit, but are doing so on operating systems
where other processes might be able to read your command line
(e.g. `/proc/self/cmdline`), but not your environment
(e.g. `/proc/self/environ`). That behavior is the default on
Linux, but may not be on your system.
+
Note that this might add security for variables such as
`http.extraHeader` where the sensitive information is part of
the value, but not e.g. `url.<base>.insteadOf` where the
sensitive information can be part of the key.

--exec-path[=<path>]::
	Path to wherever your core shit programs are installed.
	This can also be controlled by setting the shit_EXEC_PATH
	environment variable. If no path is given, 'shit' will print
	the current setting and then exit.

--html-path::
	Print the path, without trailing slash, where shit's HTML
	documentation is installed and exit.

--man-path::
	Print the manpath (see `man(1)`) for the man pages for
	this version of shit and exit.

--info-path::
	Print the path where the Info files documenting this
	version of shit are installed and exit.

-p::
--paginate::
	Pipe all output into 'less' (or if set, $PAGER) if standard
	output is a terminal.  This overrides the `pager.<cmd>`
	configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section
	below).

-P::
--no-pager::
	Do not pipe shit output into a pager.

--shit-dir=<path>::
	Set the path to the repository (".shit" directory). This can also be
	controlled by setting the `shit_DIR` environment variable. It can be
	an absolute path or relative path to current working directory.
+
Specifying the location of the ".shit" directory using this
option (or `shit_DIR` environment variable) turns off the
repository discovery that tries to find a directory with
".shit" subdirectory (which is how the repository and the
top-level of the working tree are discovered), and tells shit
that you are at the top level of the working tree.  If you
are not at the top-level directory of the working tree, you
should tell shit where the top-level of the working tree is,
with the `--work-tree=<path>` option (or `shit_WORK_TREE`
environment variable)
+
If you just want to run shit as if it was started in `<path>` then use
`shit -C <path>`.

--work-tree=<path>::
	Set the path to the working tree. It can be an absolute path
	or a path relative to the current working directory.
	This can also be controlled by setting the shit_WORK_TREE
	environment variable and the core.worktree configuration
	variable (see core.worktree in linkshit:shit-config[1] for a
	more detailed discussion).

--namespace=<path>::
	Set the shit namespace.  See linkshit:shitnamespaces[7] for more
	details.  Equivalent to setting the `shit_NAMESPACE` environment
	variable.

--bare::
	Treat the repository as a bare repository.  If shit_DIR
	environment is not set, it is set to the current working
	directory.

--no-replace-objects::
	Do not use replacement refs to replace shit objects.
	This is equivalent to exporting the `shit_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS`
	environment variable with any value.
	See linkshit:shit-replace[1] for more information.

--no-lazy-fetch::
	Do not fetch missing objects from the promisor remote on
	demand.  Useful together with `shit cat-file -e <object>` to
	see if the object is locally available.
	This is equivalent to setting the `shit_NO_LAZY_FETCH`
	environment variable to `1`.

--no-optional-locks::
	Do not perform optional operations that require locks. This is
	equivalent to setting the `shit_OPTIONAL_LOCKS` to `0`.

--no-advice::
	Disable all advice hints from being printed.

--literal-pathspecs::
	Treat pathspecs literally (i.e. no globbing, no pathspec magic).
	This is equivalent to setting the `shit_LITERAL_PATHSPECS` environment
	variable to `1`.

--glob-pathspecs::
	Add "glob" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
	the `shit_GLOB_PATHSPECS` environment variable to `1`. Disabling
	globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec
	magic ":(literal)"

--noglob-pathspecs::
	Add "literal" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
	the `shit_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS` environment variable to `1`. Enabling
	globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec
	magic ":(glob)"

--icase-pathspecs::
	Add "icase" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
	the `shit_ICASE_PATHSPECS` environment variable to `1`.

--list-cmds=<group>[,<group>...]::
	List commands by group. This is an internal/experimental
	option and may change or be removed in the future. Supported
	groups are: builtins, parseopt (builtin commands that use
	parse-options), main (all commands in libexec directory),
	others (all other commands in `$PATH` that have shit- prefix),
	list-<category> (see categories in command-list.txt),
	nohelpers (exclude helper commands), alias and config
	(retrieve command list from config variable completion.commands)

--attr-source=<tree-ish>::
	Read shitattributes from <tree-ish> instead of the worktree. See
	linkshit:shitattributes[5]. This is equivalent to setting the
	`shit_ATTR_SOURCE` environment variable.

shit COMMANDS
------------

We divide shit into high level ("porcelain") commands and low level
("plumbing") commands.

High-level commands (porcelain)
-------------------------------

We separate the porcelain commands into the main commands and some
ancillary user utilities.

Main porcelain commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

include::cmds-mainporcelain.txt[]

Ancillary Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Manipulators:

include::cmds-ancillarymanipulators.txt[]

Interrogators:

include::cmds-ancillaryinterrogators.txt[]


Interacting with Others
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These commands are to interact with foreign SCM and with other
people via patch over e-mail.

include::cmds-foreignscminterface.txt[]

Reset, restore and revert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are three commands with similar names: `shit reset`,
`shit restore` and `shit revert`.

* linkshit:shit-revert[1] is about making a new commit that reverts the
  changes made by other commits.

* linkshit:shit-restore[1] is about restoring files in the working tree
  from either the index or another commit. This command does not
  update your branch. The command can also be used to restore files in
  the index from another commit.

* linkshit:shit-reset[1] is about updating your branch, moving the tip
  in order to add or remove commits from the branch. This operation
  changes the commit history.
+
`shit reset` can also be used to restore the index, overlapping with
`shit restore`.


Low-level commands (plumbing)
-----------------------------

Although shit includes its
own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support
development of alternative porcelains.  Developers of such porcelains
might start by reading about linkshit:shit-update-index[1] and
linkshit:shit-read-tree[1].

The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics)
to these low-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable
than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are
primarily for scripted use.  The interface to Porcelain commands
on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the
end user experience.

The following description divides
the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in
the repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and
compare objects, and commands that move objects and references between
repositories.


Manipulation commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

include::cmds-plumbingmanipulators.txt[]


Interrogation commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

include::cmds-plumbinginterrogators.txt[]

In general, the interrogate commands do not touch the files in
the working tree.


Syncing repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

include::cmds-synchingrepositories.txt[]

The following are helper commands used by the above; end users
typically do not use them directly.

include::cmds-synchelpers.txt[]


Internal helper commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are internal helper commands used by other commands; end
users typically do not use them directly.

Guides
------

The following documentation pages are guides about shit concepts.

include::cmds-guide.txt[]

Repository, command and file interfaces
---------------------------------------

This documentation discusses repository and command interfaces which
users are expected to interact with directly. See `--user-formats` in
linkshit:shit-help[1] for more details on the criteria.

include::cmds-userinterfaces.txt[]

File formats, protocols and other developer interfaces
------------------------------------------------------

This documentation discusses file formats, over-the-wire protocols and
other shit developer interfaces. See `--developer-interfaces` in
linkshit:shit-help[1].

include::cmds-developerinterfaces.txt[]

Configuration Mechanism
-----------------------

shit uses a simple text format to store customizations that are per
repository and are per user.  Such a configuration file may look
like this:

------------
#
# A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
#

; core variables
[core]
	; Don't trust file modes
	filemode = false

; user identity
[user]
	name = "Junio C Hamano"
	email = "shitster@pobox.com"

------------

Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust
their operation accordingly.  See linkshit:shit-config[1] for a
list and more details about the configuration mechanism.


Identifier Terminology
----------------------
<object>::
	Indicates the object name for any type of object.

<blob>::
	Indicates a blob object name.

<tree>::
	Indicates a tree object name.

<commit>::
	Indicates a commit object name.

<tree-ish>::
	Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name.  A
	command that takes a <tree-ish> argument ultimately wants to
	operate on a <tree> object but automatically dereferences
	<commit> and <tag> objects that point at a <tree>.

<commit-ish>::
	Indicates a commit or tag object name.  A
	command that takes a <commit-ish> argument ultimately wants to
	operate on a <commit> object but automatically dereferences
	<tag> objects that point at a <commit>.

<type>::
	Indicates that an object type is required.
	Currently one of: `blob`, `tree`, `commit`, or `tag`.

<file>::
	Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the
	root of the tree structure `shit_INDEX_FILE` describes.

Symbolic Identifiers
--------------------
Any shit command accepting any <object> can also use the following
symbolic notation:

HEAD::
	indicates the head of the current branch.

<tag>::
	a valid tag 'name'
	(i.e. a `refs/tags/<tag>` reference).

<head>::
	a valid head 'name'
	(i.e. a `refs/heads/<head>` reference).

For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in linkshit:shitrevisions[7].


File/Directory Structure
------------------------

Please see the linkshit:shitrepository-layout[5] document.

Read linkshit:shithooks[5] for more details about each hook.

Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the
`$shit_DIR`.


Terminology
-----------
Please see linkshit:shitglossary[7].


Environment Variables
---------------------
Various shit commands pay attention to environment variables and change
their behavior.  The environment variables marked as "Boolean" take
their values the same way as Boolean valued configuration variables, e.g.
"true", "yes", "on" and positive numbers are taken as "yes".

Here are the variables:

The shit Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These environment variables apply to 'all' core shit commands. Nb: it
is worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above
shit so take care if using a foreign front-end.

`shit_INDEX_FILE`::
	This environment variable specifies an alternate
	index file. If not specified, the default of `$shit_DIR/index`
	is used.

`shit_INDEX_VERSION`::
	This environment variable specifies what index version is used
	when writing the index file out.  It won't affect existing index
	files.  By default index file version 2 or 3 is used. See
	linkshit:shit-update-index[1] for more information.

`shit_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`::
	If the object storage directory is specified via this
	environment variable then the sha1 directories are created
	underneath - otherwise the default `$shit_DIR/objects`
	directory is used.

`shit_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`::
	Due to the immutable nature of shit objects, old objects can be
	archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable
	specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list
	of shit object directories which can be used to search for shit
	objects. New objects will not be written to these directories.
+
Entries that begin with `"` (double-quote) will be interpreted
as C-style quoted paths, removing leading and trailing
double-quotes and respecting backslash escapes. E.g., the value
`"path-with-\"-and-:-in-it":vanilla-path` has two paths:
`path-with-"-and-:-in-it` and `vanilla-path`.

`shit_DIR`::
	If the `shit_DIR` environment variable is set then it
	specifies a path to use instead of the default `.shit`
	for the base of the repository.
	The `--shit-dir` command-line option also sets this value.

`shit_WORK_TREE`::
	Set the path to the root of the working tree.
	This can also be controlled by the `--work-tree` command-line
	option and the core.worktree configuration variable.

`shit_NAMESPACE`::
	Set the shit namespace; see linkshit:shitnamespaces[7] for details.
	The `--namespace` command-line option also sets this value.

`shit_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`::
	This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths.  If
	set, it is a list of directories that shit should not chdir up
	into while looking for a repository directory (useful for
	excluding slow-loading network directories).  It will not
	exclude the current working directory or a shit_DIR set on the
	command line or in the environment.  Normally, shit has to read
	the entries in this list and resolve any symlink that
	might be present in order to compare them with the current
	directory.  However, if even this access is slow, you
	can add an empty entry to the list to tell shit that the
	subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn't be resolved;
	e.g.,
	`shit_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink`.

`shit_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM`::
	When run in a directory that does not have ".shit" repository
	directory, shit tries to find such a directory in the parent
	directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it
	does not cross filesystem boundaries.  This Boolean environment variable
	can be set to true to tell shit not to stop at filesystem
	boundaries.  Like `shit_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`, this will not affect
	an explicit repository directory set via `shit_DIR` or on the
	command line.

`shit_COMMON_DIR`::
	If this variable is set to a path, non-worktree files that are
	normally in $shit_DIR will be taken from this path
	instead. Worktree-specific files such as HEAD or index are
	taken from $shit_DIR. See linkshit:shitrepository-layout[5] and
	linkshit:shit-worktree[1] for
	details. This variable has lower precedence than other path
	variables such as shit_INDEX_FILE, shit_OBJECT_DIRECTORY...

`shit_DEFAULT_HASH`::
	If this variable is set, the default hash algorithm for new
	repositories will be set to this value. This value is
	ignored when cloning and the setting of the remote repository
	is always used. The default is "sha1".
	See `--object-format` in linkshit:shit-init[1].

`shit_DEFAULT_REF_FORMAT`::
	If this variable is set, the default reference backend format for new
	repositories will be set to this value. The default is "files".
	See `--ref-format` in linkshit:shit-init[1].

shit Commits
~~~~~~~~~~~
`shit_AUTHOR_NAME`::
	The human-readable name used in the author identity when creating commit or
	tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.name` and
	`author.name` configuration settings.

`shit_AUTHOR_EMAIL`::
	The email address used in the author identity when creating commit or
	tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.email` and
	`author.email` configuration settings.

`shit_AUTHOR_DATE`::
	The date used for the author identity when creating commit or tag objects, or
	when writing reflogs. See linkshit:shit-commit[1] for valid formats.

`shit_COMMITTER_NAME`::
	The human-readable name used in the committer identity when creating commit or
	tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.name` and
	`committer.name` configuration settings.

`shit_COMMITTER_EMAIL`::
	The email address used in the author identity when creating commit or
	tag objects, or when writing reflogs. Overrides the `user.email` and
	`committer.email` configuration settings.

`shit_COMMITTER_DATE`::
	The date used for the committer identity when creating commit or tag objects, or
	when writing reflogs. See linkshit:shit-commit[1] for valid formats.

`EMAIL`::
	The email address used in the author and committer identities if no other
	relevant environment variable or configuration setting has been set.

shit Diffs
~~~~~~~~~
`shit_DIFF_OPTS`::
	Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the
	number of context lines shown when a unified diff is created.
	This takes precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option
	value passed on the shit diff command line.

`shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF`::
	When the environment variable `shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is set, the
	program named by it is called to generate diffs, and shit
	does not use its builtin diff machinery.
	For a path that is added, removed, or modified,
	`shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is called with 7 parameters:

	path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
+
where:

	<old|new>-file:: are files shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the
                         contents of <old|new>,
	<old|new>-hex:: are the 40-hexdishit SHA-1 hashes,
	<old|new>-mode:: are the octal representation of the file modes.
+
The file parameters can point at the user's working file
(e.g. `new-file` in "shit-diff-files"), `/dev/null` (e.g. `old-file`
when a new file is added), or a temporary file (e.g. `old-file` in the
index).  `shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF` should not worry about unlinking the
temporary file -- it is removed when `shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF` exits.
+
For a path that is unmerged, `shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is called with 1
parameter, <path>.
+
For each path `shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF` is called, two environment variables,
`shit_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER` and `shit_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL` are set.

`shit_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER`::
	A 1-based counter incremented by one for every path.

`shit_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL`::
	The total number of paths.

other
~~~~~
`shit_MERGE_VERBOSITY`::
	A number controlling the amount of output shown by
	the recursive merge strategy.  Overrides merge.verbosity.
	See linkshit:shit-merge[1]

`shit_PAGER`::
	This environment variable overrides `$PAGER`. If it is set
	to an empty string or to the value "cat", shit will not launch
	a pager.  See also the `core.pager` option in
	linkshit:shit-config[1].

`shit_PROGRESS_DELAY`::
	A number controlling how many seconds to delay before showing
	optional progress indicators. Defaults to 2.

`shit_EDITOR`::
	This environment variable overrides `$EDITOR` and `$VISUAL`.
	It is used by several shit commands when, on interactive mode,
	an editor is to be launched. See also linkshit:shit-var[1]
	and the `core.editor` option in linkshit:shit-config[1].

`shit_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`::
	This environment variable overrides the configured shit editor
	when editing the todo list of an interactive rebase. See also
	linkshit:shit-rebase[1] and the `sequence.editor` option in
	linkshit:shit-config[1].

`shit_SSH`::
`shit_SSH_COMMAND`::
	If either of these environment variables is set then 'shit fetch'
	and 'shit defecate' will use the specified command instead of 'ssh'
	when they need to connect to a remote system.
	The command-line parameters passed to the configured command are
	determined by the ssh variant.  See `ssh.variant` option in
	linkshit:shit-config[1] for details.
+
`$shit_SSH_COMMAND` takes precedence over `$shit_SSH`, and is interpreted
by the shell, which allows additional arguments to be included.
`$shit_SSH` on the other hand must be just the path to a program
(which can be a wrapper shell script, if additional arguments are
needed).
+
Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your
personal `.ssh/config` file.  Please consult your ssh documentation
for further details.

`shit_SSH_VARIANT`::
	If this environment variable is set, it overrides shit's autodetection
	whether `shit_SSH`/`shit_SSH_COMMAND`/`core.sshCommand` refer to OpenSSH,
	plink or tortoiseplink. This variable overrides the config setting
	`ssh.variant` that serves the same purpose.

`shit_SSL_NO_VERIFY`::
	Setting and exporting this environment variable to any value
	tells shit not to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or
	defecateing over HTTPS.

`shit_ATTR_SOURCE`::
	Sets the treeish that shitattributes will be read from.

`shit_ASKPASS`::
	If this environment variable is set, then shit commands which need to
	acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP authentication)
	will call this program with a suitable prompt as command-line argument
	and read the password from its STDOUT. See also the `core.askPass`
	option in linkshit:shit-config[1].

`shit_TERMINAL_PROMPT`::
	If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, shit will not prompt
	on the terminal (e.g., when asking for HTTP authentication).

`shit_CONFIG_GLOBAL`::
`shit_CONFIG_SYSTEM`::
	Take the configuration from the given files instead from global or
	system-level configuration files. If `shit_CONFIG_SYSTEM` is set, the
	system config file defined at build time (usually `/etc/shitconfig`)
	will not be read. Likewise, if `shit_CONFIG_GLOBAL` is set, neither
	`$HOME/.shitconfig` nor `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shit/config` will be read. Can
	be set to `/dev/null` to skip reading configuration files of the
	respective level.

`shit_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`::
	Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
	`$(prefix)/etc/shitconfig` file.  This Boolean environment variable can
	be used along with `$HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to create a
	predictable environment for a picky script, or you can set it
	to true to temporarily avoid using a buggy `/etc/shitconfig` file while
	waiting for someone with sufficient permissions to fix it.

`shit_FLUSH`::
	If this Boolean environment variable is set to true, then commands such
	as 'shit blame' (in incremental mode), 'shit rev-list', 'shit log',
	'shit check-attr' and 'shit check-ignore' will
	force a flush of the output stream after each record have been
	flushed. If this
	variable is set to false, the output of these commands will be done
	using completely buffered I/O.   If this environment variable is
	not set, shit will choose buffered or record-oriented flushing
	based on whether stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not.

`shit_TRACE`::
	Enables general trace messages, e.g. alias expansion, built-in
	command execution and external command execution.
+
If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison
is case insensitive), trace messages will be printed to
stderr.
+
If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2
and lower than 10 (strictly) then shit will interpret this
value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the
trace messages into this file descriptor.
+
Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path
(starting with a '/' character), shit will interpret this
as a file path and will try to append the trace messages
to it.
+
Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or
"false" (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

`shit_TRACE_FSMONITOR`::
	Enables trace messages for the filesystem monitor extension.
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS`::
	Enables trace messages for all accesses to any packs. For each
	access, the pack file name and an offset in the pack is
	recorded. This may be helpful for troubleshooting some
	pack-related performance problems.
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_PACKET`::
	Enables trace messages for all packets coming in or out of a
	given program. This can help with debugging object negotiation
	or other protocol issues. Tracing is turned off at a packet
	starting with "PACK" (but see `shit_TRACE_PACKFILE` below).
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_PACKFILE`::
	Enables tracing of packfiles sent or received by a
	given program. Unlike other trace output, this trace is
	verbatim: no headers, and no quoting of binary data. You almost
	certainly want to direct into a file (e.g.,
	`shit_TRACE_PACKFILE=/tmp/my.pack`) rather than displaying it on
	the terminal or mixing it with other trace output.
+
Note that this is currently only implemented for the client side
of clones and fetches.

`shit_TRACE_PERFORMANCE`::
	Enables performance related trace messages, e.g. total execution
	time of each shit command.
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_REFS`::
	Enables trace messages for operations on the ref database.
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_SETUP`::
	Enables trace messages printing the .shit, working tree and current
	working directory after shit has completed its setup phase.
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_SHALLOW`::
	Enables trace messages that can help debugging fetching /
	cloning of shallow repositories.
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_CURL`::
	Enables a curl full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data,
	including descriptive information, of the shit transport protocol.
	This is similar to doing curl `--trace-ascii` on the command line.
	See `shit_TRACE` for available trace output options.

`shit_TRACE_CURL_NO_DATA`::
	When a curl trace is enabled (see `shit_TRACE_CURL` above), do not dump
	data (that is, only dump info lines and headers).

`shit_TRACE2`::
	Enables more detailed trace messages from the "trace2" library.
	Output from `shit_TRACE2` is a simple text-based format for human
	readability.
+
If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison
is case insensitive), trace messages will be printed to
stderr.
+
If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2
and lower than 10 (strictly) then shit will interpret this
value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the
trace messages into this file descriptor.
+
Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path
(starting with a '/' character), shit will interpret this
as a file path and will try to append the trace messages
to it.  If the path already exists and is a directory, the
trace messages will be written to files (one per process)
in that directory, named according to the last component
of the SID and an optional counter (to avoid filename
collisions).
+
In addition, if the variable is set to
`af_unix:[<socket-type>:]<absolute-pathname>`, shit will try
to open the path as a Unix Domain Socket.  The socket type
can be either `stream` or `dgram`.
+
Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or
"false" (case insensitive) disables trace messages.
+
See link:technical/api-trace2.html[Trace2 documentation]
for full details.


`shit_TRACE2_EVENT`::
	This setting writes a JSON-based format that is suited for machine
	interpretation.
	See `shit_TRACE2` for available trace output options and
	link:technical/api-trace2.html[Trace2 documentation] for full details.

`shit_TRACE2_PERF`::
	In addition to the text-based messages available in `shit_TRACE2`, this
	setting writes a column-based format for understanding nesting
	regions.
	See `shit_TRACE2` for available trace output options and
	link:technical/api-trace2.html[Trace2 documentation] for full details.

`shit_TRACE_REDACT`::
	By default, when tracing is activated, shit redacts the values of
	cookies, the "Authorization:" header, the "Proxy-Authorization:"
	header and packfile URIs. Set this Boolean environment variable to false to prevent this
	redaction.

`shit_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS`::
	Setting and exporting this environment variable tells shit to
	ignore replacement refs and do not replace shit objects.

`shit_LITERAL_PATHSPECS`::
	Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause shit to treat all
	pathspecs literally, rather than as glob patterns. For example,
	running `shit_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1 shit log -- '*.c'` will search
	for commits that touch the path `*.c`, not any paths that the
	glob `*.c` matches. You might want this if you are feeding
	literal paths to shit (e.g., paths previously given to you by
	`shit ls-tree`, `--raw` diff output, etc).

`shit_GLOB_PATHSPECS`::
	Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause shit to treat all
	pathspecs as glob patterns (aka "glob" magic).

`shit_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS`::
	Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause shit to treat all
	pathspecs as literal (aka "literal" magic).

`shit_ICASE_PATHSPECS`::
	Setting this Boolean environment variable to true will cause shit to treat all
	pathspecs as case-insensitive.

`shit_NO_LAZY_FETCH`::
	Setting this Boolean environment variable to true tells shit
	not to lazily fetch missing objects from the promisor remote
	on demand.

`shit_REFLOG_ACTION`::
	When a ref is updated, reflog entries are created to keep
	track of the reason why the ref was updated (which is
	typically the name of the high-level command that updated
	the ref), in addition to the old and new values of the ref.
	A scripted Porcelain command can use set_reflog_action
	helper function in `shit-sh-setup` to set its name to this
	variable when it is invoked as the top level command by the
	end user, to be recorded in the body of the reflog.

`shit_REF_PARANOIA`::
	If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, ignore broken or badly named refs when iterating
	over lists of refs. Normally shit will try to include any such
	refs, which may cause some operations to fail. This is usually
	preferable, as potentially destructive operations (e.g.,
	linkshit:shit-prune[1]) are better off aborting rather than
	ignoring broken refs (and thus considering the history they
	point to as not worth saving). The default value is `1` (i.e.,
	be paranoid about detecting and aborting all operations). You
	should not normally need to set this to `0`, but it may be
	useful when trying to salvage data from a corrupted repository.

`shit_COMMIT_GRAPH_PARANOIA`::
	When loading a commit object from the commit-graph, shit performs an
	existence check on the object in the object database. This is done to
	avoid issues with stale commit-graphs that contain references to
	already-deleted commits, but comes with a performance penalty.
+
The default is "false", which disables the aforementioned behavior.
Setting this to "true" enables the existence check so that stale commits
will never be returned from the commit-graph at the cost of performance.

`shit_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`::
	If set to a colon-separated list of protocols, behave as if
	`protocol.allow` is set to `never`, and each of the listed
	protocols has `protocol.<name>.allow` set to `always`
	(overriding any existing configuration). See the description of
	`protocol.allow` in linkshit:shit-config[1] for more details.

`shit_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER`::
	Set this Boolean environment variable to false to prevent protocols used by fetch/defecate/clone which are
	configured to the `user` state.  This is useful to restrict recursive
	submodule initialization from an untrusted repository or for programs
	which feed potentially-untrusted URLS to shit commands.  See
	linkshit:shit-config[1] for more details.

`shit_PROTOCOL`::
	For internal use only.  Used in handshaking the wire protocol.
	Contains a colon ':' separated list of keys with optional values
	'<key>[=<value>]'.  Presence of unknown keys and values must be
	ignored.
+
Note that servers may need to be configured to allow this variable to
pass over some transports. It will be propagated automatically when
accessing local repositories (i.e., `file://` or a filesystem path), as
well as over the `shit://` protocol. For shit-over-http, it should work
automatically in most configurations, but see the discussion in
linkshit:shit-http-backend[1]. For shit-over-ssh, the ssh server may need
to be configured to allow clients to pass this variable (e.g., by using
`AcceptEnv shit_PROTOCOL` with OpenSSH).
+
This configuration is optional. If the variable is not propagated, then
clients will fall back to the original "v0" protocol (but may miss out
on some performance improvements or features). This variable currently
only affects clones and fetches; it is not yet used for defecatees (but may
be in the future).

`shit_OPTIONAL_LOCKS`::
	If this Boolean environment variable is set to false, shit will complete any requested operation without
	performing any optional sub-operations that require taking a lock.
	For example, this will prevent `shit status` from refreshing the
	index as a side effect. This is useful for processes running in
	the background which do not want to cause lock contention with
	other operations on the repository.  Defaults to `1`.

`shit_REDIRECT_STDIN`::
`shit_REDIRECT_STDOUT`::
`shit_REDIRECT_STDERR`::
	Windows-only: allow redirecting the standard input/output/error
	handles to paths specified by the environment variables. This is
	particularly useful in multi-threaded applications where the
	canonical way to pass standard handles via `CreateProcess()` is
	not an option because it would require the handles to be marked
	inheritable (and consequently *every* spawned process would
	inherit them, possibly blocking regular shit operations). The
	primary intended use case is to use named pipes for communication
	(e.g. `\\.\pipe\my-shit-stdin-123`).
+
Two special values are supported: `off` will simply close the
corresponding standard handle, and if `shit_REDIRECT_STDERR` is
`2>&1`, standard error will be redirected to the same handle as
standard output.

`shit_PRINT_SHA1_ELLIPSIS` (deprecated)::
	If set to `yes`, print an ellipsis following an
	(abbreviated) SHA-1 value.  This affects indications of
	detached HEADs (linkshit:shit-checkout[1]) and the raw
	diff output (linkshit:shit-diff[1]).  Printing an
	ellipsis in the cases mentioned is no longer considered
	adequate and support for it is likely to be removed in the
	foreseeable future (along with the variable).

Discussion[[Discussion]]
------------------------

More detail on the following is available from the
link:user-manual.html#shit-concepts[shit concepts chapter of the
user-manual] and linkshit:shitcore-tutorial[7].

A shit project normally consists of a working directory with a ".shit"
subdirectory at the top level.  The .shit directory contains, among other
things, a compressed object database representing the complete history
of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current
contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such
as tags and branch heads.

The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which
hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up
directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree
and some number of parent commits.

The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or
"version", represents a step in the project's history, and each parent
represents an immediately preceding step.  Commits with more than one
parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

All objects are named by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, normally
written as a string of 40 hex dishits.  Such names are globally unique.
The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing
just that commit.  A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this
purpose.

When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for
efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files".

Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history.  A ref
may contain the SHA-1 name of an object or the name of another ref (the
latter is called a "symbolic ref").
Refs with names beginning `refs/head/` contain the SHA-1 name of the most
recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development.  SHA-1 names of
tags of interest are stored under `refs/tags/`.  A symbolic ref named
`HEAD` contains the name of the currently checked-out branch.

The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each
path, a blob object and a set of attributes.  The blob object represents
the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch.  The
attributes (last modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the
corresponding file in the working tree.  Subsequent changes to the
working tree can be found by comparing these attributes.  The index may
be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the
content stored in the index.

The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages")
for a given pathname.  These stages are used to hold the various
unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress.

SECURITY
--------

Some configuration options and hook files may cause shit to run arbitrary
shell commands. Because configuration and hooks are not copied using
`shit clone`, it is generally safe to clone remote repositories with
untrusted content, inspect them with `shit log`, and so on.

However, it is not safe to run shit commands in a `.shit` directory (or
the working tree that surrounds it) when that `.shit` directory itself
comes from an untrusted source. The commands in its config and hooks
are executed in the usual way.

By default, shit will refuse to run when the repository is owned by
someone other than the user running the command. See the entry for
`safe.directory` in linkshit:shit-config[1]. While this can help protect
you in a multi-user environment, note that you can also acquire
untrusted repositories that are owned by you (for example, if you
extract a zip file or tarball from an untrusted source). In such cases,
you'd need to "sanitize" the untrusted repository first.

If you have an untrusted `.shit` directory, you should first clone it
with `shit clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. shit does restrict
the set of options and hooks that will be run by `upload-pack`, which
handles the server side of a clone or fetch, but beware that the
surface area for attack against `upload-pack` is large, so this does
carry some risk. The safest thing is to serve the repository as an
unprivileged user (either via linkshit:shit-daemon[1], ssh, or using
other tools to change user ids). See the discussion in the `SECURITY`
section of linkshit:shit-upload-pack[1].
