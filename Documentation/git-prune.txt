shit-prune(1)
============

NAME
----
shit-prune - Prune all unreachable objects from the object database


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit prune' [-n] [-v] [--progress] [--expire <time>] [--] [<head>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

NOTE: In most cases, users should run 'shit gc', which calls
'shit prune'. See the section "NOTES", below.

This runs 'shit fsck --unreachable' using all the refs
available in `refs/`, optionally with an additional set of
objects specified on the command line, and prunes all unpacked
objects unreachable from any of these head objects from the object database.
In addition, it
prunes the unpacked objects that are also found in packs by
running 'shit prune-packed'.
It also removes entries from .shit/shallow that are not reachable by
any ref.

Note that unreachable, packed objects will remain.  If this is
not desired, see linkshit:shit-repack[1].

OPTIONS
-------

-n::
--dry-run::
	Do not remove anything; just report what it would
	remove.

-v::
--verbose::
	Report all removed objects.

--progress::
	Show progress.

--expire <time>::
	Only expire loose objects older than <time>.

\--::
	Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

<head>...::
	In addition to objects
	reachable from any of our references, keep objects
	reachable from listed <head>s.

EXAMPLES
--------

To prune objects not used by your repository or another that
borrows from your repository via its
`.shit/objects/info/alternates`:

------------
$ shit prune $(cd ../another && shit rev-parse --all)
------------

NOTES
-----

In most cases, users will not need to call 'shit prune' directly, but
should instead call 'shit gc', which handles pruning along with
many other housekeeping tasks.

For a description of which objects are considered for pruning, see
'shit fsck''s --unreachable option.
