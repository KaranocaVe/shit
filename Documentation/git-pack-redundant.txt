shit-pack-redundant(1)
=====================

NAME
----
shit-pack-redundant - Find redundant pack files


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit pack-redundant' [--verbose] [--alt-odb] (--all | <pack-filename>...)

WARNING
-------
`shit pack-redundant` has been deprecated and is scheduled for removal in
a future version of shit. Because it can only remove entire duplicate
packs and not individual duplicate objects, it is generally not a useful
tool for reducing repository size. You are better off using `shit gc` to
do so, which will put objects into a new pack, removing duplicates.

Running `pack-redundant` without the `--i-still-use-this` flag will fail
in this release. If you believe you have a use case for which
`pack-redundant` is better suited and oppose this removal, please
contact the shit mailing list at shit@vger.kernel.org. More information
about the list is available at https://shit-scm.com/community.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program computes which packs in your repository
are redundant. The output is suitable for piping to
`xargs rm` if you are in the root of the repository.

'shit pack-redundant' accepts a list of objects on standard input. Any objects
given will be ignored when checking which packs are required. This makes the
following command useful when wanting to remove packs which contain unreachable
objects.

shit fsck --full --unreachable | cut -d ' ' -f3 | \
shit pack-redundant --all | xargs rm

OPTIONS
-------


--all::
	Processes all packs. Any filenames on the command line are ignored.

--alt-odb::
	Don't require objects present in packs from alternate object
	database (odb) directories to be present in local packs.

--verbose::
	Outputs some statistics to stderr. Has a small performance penalty.
