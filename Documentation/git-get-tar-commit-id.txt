shit-get-tar-commit-id(1)
========================

NAME
----
shit-get-tar-commit-id - Extract commit ID from an archive created using shit-archive


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit get-tar-commit-id'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Read a tar archive created by 'shit archive' from the standard input
and extract the commit ID stored in it.  It reads only the first
1024 bytes of input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the size
of the tar archive very much.

If no commit ID is found, 'shit get-tar-commit-id' quietly exits with a
return code of 1.  This can happen if the archive had not been created
using 'shit archive' or if the first parameter of 'shit archive' had been
a tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag.
