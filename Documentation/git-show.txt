NAME
----
shit-show - Show various types of objects


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit show' [<options>] [<object>...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by
'shit diff-tree --cc'.

For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.

For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to 'shit ls-tree'
with --name-only).

For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.

Some options that 'shit log' command understands can be used to
control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.

This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.


OPTIONS
-------
<object>...::
	The names of objects to show (defaults to 'HEAD').
	For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see
	"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in linkshit:shitrevisions[7].
