shit-hook(1)
===========

NAME
----
shit-hook - Run shit hooks

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit hook' run [--ignore-missing] [--to-stdin=<path>] <hook-name> [-- <hook-args>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A command interface for running shit hooks (see linkshit:shithooks[5]),
for use by other scripted shit commands.

SUBCOMMANDS
-----------

run::
	Run the `<hook-name>` hook. See linkshit:shithooks[5] for
	supported hook names.
+

Any positional arguments to the hook should be passed after a
mandatory `--` (or `--end-of-options`, see linkshit:shitcli[7]). See
linkshit:shithooks[5] for arguments hooks might expect (if any).

OPTIONS
-------

--to-stdin::
	For "run"; specify a file which will be streamed into the
	hook's stdin. The hook will receive the entire file from
	beginning to EOF.

--ignore-missing::
	Ignore any missing hook by quietly returning zero. Used for
	tools that want to do a blind one-shot run of a hook that may
	or may not be present.
