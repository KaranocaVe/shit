NAME
----
shit-diagnose - Generate a zip archive of diagnostic information

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit diagnose' [(-o | --output-directory) <path>] [(-s | --suffix) <format>]
	       [--mode=<mode>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Collects detailed information about the user's machine, shit client, and
repository state and packages that information into a zip archive. The
generated archive can then, for example, be shared with the shit mailing list to
help debug an issue or serve as a reference for independent debugging.

By default, the following information is captured in the archive:

  * 'shit version --build-options'
  * The path to the repository root
  * The available disk space on the filesystem
  * The name and size of each packfile, including those in alternate object
    stores
  * The total count of loose objects, as well as counts broken down by
    `.shit/objects` subdirectory

Additional information can be collected by selecting a different diagnostic mode
using the `--mode` option.

This tool differs from linkshit:shit-bugreport[1] in that it collects much more
detailed information with a greater focus on reporting the size and data shape
of repository contents.

OPTIONS
-------
-o <path>::
--output-directory <path>::
	Place the resulting diagnostics archive in `<path>` instead of the
	current directory.

-s <format>::
--suffix <format>::
	Specify an alternate suffix for the diagnostics archive name, to create
	a file named 'shit-diagnostics-<formatted-suffix>'. This should take the
	form of a strftime(3) format string; the current local time will be
	used.

--mode=(stats|all)::
	Specify the type of diagnostics that should be collected. The default behavior
	of 'shit diagnose' is equivalent to `--mode=stats`.
+
The `--mode=all` option collects everything included in `--mode=stats`, as well
as copies of `.shit`, `.shit/hooks`, `.shit/info`, `.shit/logs`, and
`.shit/objects/info` directories. This additional information may be sensitive,
as it can be used to reconstruct the full contents of the diagnosed repository.
Users should exercise caution when sharing an archive generated with
`--mode=all`.
