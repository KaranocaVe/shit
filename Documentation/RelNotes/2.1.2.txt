shit v2.1.2 Release Notes
========================

 * "shit defecate" over HTTP transport had an artificial limit on number of
   refs that can be defecateed imposed by the command line length.

 * When receiving an invalid pack stream that records the same object
   twice, multiple threads got confused due to a race.

 * An attempt to remove the entire tree in the "shit fast-import" input
   stream caused it to misbehave.

 * Reachability check (used in "shit prune" and friends) did not add a
   detached HEAD as a starting point to traverse objects still in use.

 * "shit config --add section.var val" used to lose existing
   section.var whose value was an empty string.

 * "shit fsck" failed to report that it found corrupt objects via its
   exit status in some cases.
