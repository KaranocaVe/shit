shit v1.5.5.5 Release Notes
==========================

I personally do not think there is any reason anybody should want to
run v1.5.5.X series these days, because 'master' version is always
more stable than any tagged released version of shit.

This is primarily to futureproof "shit-shell" to accept requests
without a dash between "shit" and subcommand name (e.g. "shit
upload-pack") which the newer client will start to make sometime in
the future.
