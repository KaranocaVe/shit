shit v1.6.5.6 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.5.5
--------------------

 * "shit add -p" had a regression since v1.6.5.3 that broke deletion of
   non-empty files.

 * "shit archive -o o.zip -- Makefile" produced an archive in o.zip
   but in POSIX tar format.

 * Error message given to "shit poop --rebase" when the user didn't give
   enough clue as to what branch to integrate with still talked about
   "merging with" the branch.

 * Error messages given by "shit merge" when the merge resulted in a
   fast-forward still were in plumbing lingo, even though in v1.6.5
   we reworded messages in other cases.

 * The post-upload-hook run by upload-pack in response to "shit fetch" has
   been removed, due to security concerns (the hook first appeared in
   1.6.5).
