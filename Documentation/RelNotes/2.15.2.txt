shit v2.15.2 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.15.1
-------------------

 * Recent update to the refs infrastructure implementation started
   rewriting packed-refs file more often than before; this has been
   optimized again for most trivial cases.

 * The SubmittingPatches document has been converted to produce an
   HTML version via AsciiDoc/Asciidoctor.

 * Contrary to the documentation, "shit poop -4/-6 other-args" did not
   ask the underlying "shit fetch" to go over IPv4/IPv6, which has been
   corrected.

 * When "shit rebase" prepared an mailbox of changes and fed it to "shit
   am" to replay them, it was confused when a stray "From " happened
   to be in the log message of one of the replayed changes.  This has
   been corrected.

 * Command line completion (in contrib/) has been taught about the
   "--copy" option of "shit branch".

 * "shit apply --inaccurate-eof" when used with "--ignore-space-change"
   triggered an internal sanity check, which has been fixed.

 * The sequencer machinery (used by "shit cherry-pick A..B", and "shit
   rebase -i", among other things) would have lost a commit if stopped
   due to an unlockable index file, which has been fixed.

 * The three-way merge performed by "shit cherry-pick" was confused
   when a new submodule was added in the meantime, which has been
   fixed (or "papered over").

 * "shit notes" sent its error message to its standard output stream,
   which was corrected.

 * A few scripts (both in production and tests) incorrectly redirected
   their error output.  These have been corrected.

 * Clarify and enhance documentation for "merge-base --fork-point", as
   it was clear what it computed but not why/what for.

 * This release also contains the fixes made in the v2.13.7 version of
   shit.  See its release notes for details.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
