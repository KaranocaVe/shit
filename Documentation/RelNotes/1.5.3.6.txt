shit v1.5.3.6 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.3.5
--------------------

 * shit-cvsexportcommit handles root commits better.

 * shit-svn dcommit used to clobber when sending a series of
   patches.

 * shit-svn dcommit failed after attempting to rebase when
   started with a dirty index; now it stops upfront.

 * shit-grep sometimes refused to work when your index was
   unmerged.

 * "shit-grep -A1 -B2" acted as if it was told to run "shit -A1 -B21".

 * shit-hash-object did not honor configuration variables, such as
   core.compression.

 * shit-index-pack choked on a huge pack on 32-bit machines, even when
   large file offsets are supported.

 * atom feeds from shit-web said "10" for the month of November.

 * a memory leak in commit walker was plugged.

 * When shit-send-email inserted the original author's From:
   address in body, it did not mark the message with
   Content-type: as needed.

 * shit-revert and shit-cherry-pick incorrectly refused to start
   when the work tree was dirty.

 * shit-clean did not honor core.excludesfile configuration.

 * shit-add mishandled ".shitignore" files when applying them to
   subdirectories.

 * While importing a too branchy history, shit-fastimport did not
   honor delta depth limit properly.

 * Support for zlib implementations that lack ZLIB_VERNUM and definition
   of deflateBound() has been added.

 * Quite a lot of documentation clarifications.
