shit v2.30.2 Release Notes
=========================

This release addresses the security issue CVE-2022-24765.

Fixes since v2.30.2
-------------------

 * Build fix on Windows.

 * Fix `shit_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` with Windows-style root directories.

 * CVE-2022-24765:
   On multi-user machines, shit users might find themselves
   unexpectedly in a shit worktree, e.g. when another user created a
   repository in `C:\.shit`, in a mounted network drive or in a
   scratch space. Merely having a shit-aware prompt that runs `shit
   status` (or `shit diff`) and navigating to a directory which is
   supposedly not a shit worktree, or opening such a directory in an
   editor or IDE such as VS Code or Atom, will potentially run
   commands defined by that other user.

Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to 俞晨东; The fix was
authored by Johannes Schindelin.
