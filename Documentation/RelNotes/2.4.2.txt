shit v2.4.2 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.4.1
------------------

 * "shit rev-list --objects $old --not --all" to see if everything that
   is reachable from $old is already connected to the existing refs
   was very inefficient.

 * "hash-object --literally" introduced in v2.2 was not prepared to
   take a really long object type name.

 * "shit rebase --quiet" was not quite quiet when there is nothing to
   do.

 * The completion for "log --decorate=" parameter value was incorrect.

 * "filter-branch" corrupted commit log message that ends with an
   incomplete line on platforms with some "sed" implementations that
   munge such a line.  Work it around by avoiding to use "sed".

 * "shit daemon" fails to build from the source under NO_IPV6
   configuration (regression in 2.4).

 * "shit stash pop/apply" forgot to make sure that not just the working
   tree is clean but also the index is clean. The latter is important
   as a stash application can conflict and the index will be used for
   conflict resolution.

 * We have prepended $shit_EXEC_PATH and the path "shit" is installed in
   (typically "/usr/bin") to $PATH when invoking subprograms and hooks
   for almost eternity, but the original use case the latter tried to
   support was semi-bogus (i.e. install shit to /opt/foo/shit and run it
   without having /opt/foo on $PATH), and more importantly it has
   become less and less relevant as shit grew more mainstream (i.e. the
   users would _want_ to have it on their $PATH).  Stop prepending the
   path in which "shit" is installed to users' $PATH, as that would
   interfere the command search order people depend on (e.g. they may
   not like versions of programs that are unrelated to shit in /usr/bin
   and want to override them by having different ones in /usr/local/bin
   and have the latter directory earlier in their $PATH).

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code
clean-ups.
