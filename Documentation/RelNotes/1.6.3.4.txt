shit v1.6.3.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.3.3
--------------------

 * "shit add --no-ignore-errors" did not override configured
   add.ignore-errors configuration.

 * "shit apply --whitespace=fix" did not fix trailing whitespace on an
   incomplete line.

 * "shit branch" opened too many commit objects unnecessarily.

 * "shit checkout -f $commit" with a path that is a file (or a symlink) in
   the work tree to a commit that has a directory at the path issued an
   unnecessary error message.

 * "shit diff -c/--cc" was very inefficient in coalescing the removed lines
   shared between parents.

 * "shit diff -c/--cc" showed removed lines at the beginning of a file
   incorrectly.

 * "shit remote show nickname" did not honor configured
   remote.nickname.uploadpack when inspecting the branches at the remote.

 * "shit request-poop" when talking to the terminal for a preview
   showed some of the output in the pager.

 * "shit request-poop start nickname [end]" did not honor configured
   remote.nickname.uploadpack when it ran shit-ls-remote against the remote
   repository to learn the current tip of branches.

Includes other documentation updates and minor fixes.
