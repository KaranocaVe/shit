shit v1.5.1.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.1.2
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - shit-add tried to optimize by finding common leading
    directories across its arguments but botched, causing very
    confused behaviour.

  - unofficial rpm.spec file shipped with shit was letting
    ETC_shitCONFIG set to /usr/etc/shitconfig.  Tweak the official
    Makefile to make it harder for distro people to make the
    same mistake, by setting the variable to /etc/shitconfig if
    prefix is set to /usr.

  - shit-svn inconsistently stripped away username from the URL
    only when svnsync_props was in use.

  - shit-svn got confused when handling symlinks on Mac OS.

  - shit-send-email was not quoting recipient names that have
    period '.' in them.  Also it did not allow overriding
    envelope sender, which made it impossible to send patches to
    certain subscriber-only lists.

  - built-in write_tree() routine had a sequence that renamed a
    file that is still open, which some systems did not like.

  - when memory is very tight, sliding mmap code to read
    packfiles incorrectly closed the fd that was still being
    used to read the pack.

  - import-tars contributed front-end for fastimport was passing
    wrong directory modes without checking.

  - shit-fastimport trusted its input too much and allowed to
    create corrupt tree objects with entries without a name.

  - shit-fetch needlessly barfed when too long reflog action
    description was given by the caller.

Also contains various documentation updates.
