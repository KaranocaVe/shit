shit v1.6.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.1
------------------

* "shit add frotz/nitfol" when "frotz" is a submodule should have errored
  out, but it didn't.

* "shit apply" took file modes from the patch text and updated the mode
  bits of the target tree even when the patch was not about mode changes.

* "shit bisect view" on Cygwin did not launch shitk

* "shit checkout $tree" did not trigger an error.

* "shit commit" tried to remove COMMIT_EDITMSG from the work tree by mistake.

* "shit describe --all" complained when a commit is described with a tag,
  which was nonsense.

* "shit diff --no-index --" did not trigger no-index (aka "use shit-diff as
  a replacement of diff on untracked files") behaviour.

* "shit format-patch -1 HEAD" on a root commit failed to produce patch
  text.

* "shit fsck branch" did not work as advertised; instead it behaved the same
  way as "shit fsck".

* "shit log --pretty=format:%s" did not handle a multi-line subject the
  same way as built-in log listers (i.e. shortlog, --pretty=oneline, etc.)

* "shit daemon", and "shit merge-file" are more careful when freopen fails
  and barf, instead of going on and writing to unopened filehandle.

* "shit http-defecate" did not like some RFC 4918 compliant DAV server
  responses.

* "shit merge -s recursive" mistakenly overwritten an untracked file in the
  work tree upon delete/modify conflict.

* "shit merge -s recursive" didn't leave the index unmerged for entries with
  rename/delete conflicts.

* "shit merge -s recursive" clobbered untracked files in the work tree.

* "shit mv -k" with more than one erroneous paths misbehaved.

* "shit read-tree -m -u" hence branch switching incorrectly lost a
  subdirectory in rare cases.

* "shit rebase -i" issued an unnecessary error message upon a user error of
  marking the first commit to be "squash"ed.

* "shit shortlog" did not format a commit message with multi-line
  subject correctly.

Many documentation updates.
