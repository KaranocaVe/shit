shit 2.42.1 Release Notes
========================

There is nothing exciting to see here.  Relative to shit 2.42, this
release contains the fixes that have already been merged to the
'master' branch of the development towards shit 2.43 that has been
tagged as shit 2.43.0-rc0.

Fixes since shit 2.42.0
----------------------

 * Tests that are known to pass with LSan are now marked as such.

 * Flaky "shit p4" tests, as well as "shit svn" tests, are now skipped
   in the (rather expensive) sanitizer CI job.

 * Tests with LSan from time to time seem to emit harmless message
   that makes our tests unnecessarily flaky; we work it around by
   filtering the uninteresting output.

 * shitHub CI workflow has learned to trigger Coverity check.

 * Overly long label names used in the sequencer machinery are now
   chopped to fit under filesystem limitation.

 * Scalar updates.

 * Tweak shitHub Actions CI so that defecateing the same commit to multiple
   branch tips at the same time will not waste building and testing
   the same thing twice.

 * The commit-graph verification code that detects mixture of zero and
   non-zero generation numbers has been updated.

 * "shit diff -w --exit-code" with various options did not work
   correctly, which is being addressed.

 * transfer.unpackLimit ought to be used as a fallback, but overrode
   fetch.unpackLimit and receive.unpackLimit instead.

 * The use of API between two calls to require_clean_work_tree() from
   the sequencer code has been cleaned up for consistency.

 * "shit diff --no-such-option" and other corner cases around the exit
   status of the "diff" command has been corrected.

 * "shit for-each-ref --sort='contents:size'" sorts the refs according
   to size numerically, giving a ref that points at a blob twelve-byte
   (12) long before showing a blob hundred-byte (100) long.

 * Various fixes to the behavior of "rebase -i" when the command got
   interrupted by conflicting changes.

 * References from description of the `--patch` option in various
   manual pages have been simplified and improved.

 * "shit grep -e A --no-or -e B" is accepted, even though the negation
   of "or" did not mean anything, which has been tightened.

 * The completion script (in contrib/) has been taught to treat the
   "-t" option to "shit checkout" and "shit switch" just like the
   "--track" option, to complete remote-tracking branches.

 * "shit diff --no-index -R <(one) <(two)" did not work correctly,
   which has been corrected.

 * Update "shit maintenance" timers' implementation based on systemd
   timers to work with WSL.

 * "shit diff --cached" codepath did not fill the necessary stat
   information for a file when fsmonitor knows it is clean and ended
   up behaving as if it is not clean, which has been corrected.

 * Clarify how "alias.foo = : shit cmd ; aliased-command-string" should
   be spelled with necessary whitespaces around punctuation marks to
   work.

 * HTTP Header redaction code has been adjusted for a newer version of
   cURL library that shows its traces differently from earlier
   versions.

 * An error message given by "shit send-email" when given a malformed
   address did not give correct information, which has been corrected.

 * UBSan options were not propagated through the test framework to shit
   run via the httpd, unlike ASan options, which has been corrected.

Also contains various documentation updates, code clean-ups and minor fixups.
