shit v1.7.0.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.0.2
--------------------

 * Object files are created in a more ACL friendly way in repositories
   where group permission is ACL controlled.

 * "shit add -i" didn't handle a deleted path very well.

 * "shit blame" padded line numbers with one extra SP when the total number
   of lines was one less than multiple of ten due to an off-by-one error.

 * "shit fetch --all/--multi" used to discard information for remotes that
   are fetched earlier.

 * "shit log --author=me --grep=it" tried to find commits that have "it"
   or are written by "me", instead of the ones that have "it" _and_ are
   written by "me".

 * "shit log -g branch" misbehaved when there was no entries in the reflog
   for the named branch.

 * "shit mailinfo" (hence "shit am") incorrectly removed initial indent from
   paragraphs.

 * "shit prune" and "shit reflog" (hence "shit gc" as well) didn't honor
   an instruction never to expire by setting gc.reflogexpire to never.

 * "shit defecate" misbehaved when branch.<name>.merge was configured without
   matching branch.<name>.remote.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
