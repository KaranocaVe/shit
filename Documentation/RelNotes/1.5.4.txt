shit v1.5.4 Release Notes
========================

Removal
-------

 * "shit svnimport" was removed in favor of "shit svn".  It is still there
   in the source tree (contrib/examples) but unsupported.

 * As shit-commit and shit-status have been rewritten, "shit runstatus"
   helper script lost all its users and has been removed.


Temporarily disabled
--------------------

 * "shit http-defecate" is known not to work well with cURL library older
   than 7.16, and we had reports of repository corruption.  It is
   disabled on such platforms for now.  Unfortunately, 1.5.3.8 shares
   the same issue.  In other words, this does not mean you will be
   fine if you stick to an older shit release.  For now, please do not
   use http-defecate from older shit with cURL older than 7.16 if you
   value your data. A proper fix will hopefully materialize in
   later versions.


Deprecation notices
-------------------

 * From v1.6.0, shit will by default install dashed form of commands
   (e.g. "shit-commit") outside of users' normal $PATH, and will install
   only selected commands ("shit" itself, and "shitk") in $PATH.  This
   implies:

   - Using dashed forms of shit commands (e.g. "shit-commit") from the
     command line has been informally deprecated since early 2006, but
     now it officially is, and will be removed in the future.  Use
     dash-less forms (e.g. "shit commit") instead.

   - Using dashed forms from your scripts, without first prepending the
     return value from "shit --exec-path" to the scripts' PATH, has been
     informally deprecated since early 2006, but now it officially is.

   - Use of dashed forms with "PATH=$(shit --exec-path):$PATH; export
     PATH" early in your script is not deprecated with this change.

   Users are strongly encouraged to adjust their habits and scripts now
   to prepare for this change.

 * The post-receive hook was introduced in March 2007 to supersede
   the post-update hook, primarily to overcome the command line length
   limitation of the latter.  Use of post-update hook will be deprecated
   in future versions of shit, starting from v1.6.0.

 * "shit lost-found" was deprecated in favor of "shit fsck"'s --lost-found
   option, and will be removed in the future.

 * "shit peek-remote" is deprecated, as "shit ls-remote" was written in C
   and works for all transports; "shit peek-remote" will be removed in
   the future.

 * "shit repo-config" which was an old name for "shit config" command
   has been supported without being advertised for a long time.  The
   next feature release will remove it.

 * From v1.6.0, the repack.usedeltabaseoffset config option will default
   to true, which will give denser packfiles (i.e. more efficient storage).
   The downside is that shit older than version 1.4.4 will not be able
   to directly use a repository packed using this setting.

 * From v1.6.0, the pack.indexversion config option will default to 2,
   which is slightly more efficient, and makes repacking more immune to
   data corruptions.  shit older than version 1.5.2 may revert to version 1
   of the pack index with a manual "shit index-pack" to be able to directly
   access corresponding pack files.


Updates since v1.5.3
--------------------

 * Comes with much improved shitk, with i18n.

 * Comes with shit-gui 0.9.2 with i18n.

 * shitk is now merged as a subdirectory of shit.shit project, in
   preparation for its i18n.

 * progress displays from many commands are a lot nicer to the eye.
   Transfer commands show throughput data.

 * many commands that pay attention to per-directory .shitignore now do
   so lazily, which makes the usual case go much faster.

 * Output processing for '--pretty=format:<user format>' has been
   optimized.

 * Rename detection of diff family while detecting exact matches has
   been greatly optimized.

 * Rename detection of diff family tries to make more natural looking
   pairing.  Earlier, if multiple identical rename sources were
   found in the preimage, the source used was picked pretty much at random.

 * Value "true" for color.diff and color.status configuration used to
   mean "always" (even when the output is not going to a terminal).
   This has been corrected to mean the same thing as "auto".

 * "shit diff" Porcelain now respects diff.external configuration, which
   is another way to specify shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF.

 * "shit diff" can be told to use different prefixes other than
   "a/" and "b/" e.g. "shit diff --src-prefix=l/ --dst-prefix=k/".

 * "shit diff" sometimes did not quote paths with funny
   characters properly.

 * "shit log" (and any revision traversal commands) misbehaved
   when --diff-filter is given but was not asked to actually
   produce diff.

 * HTTP proxy can be specified per remote repository using
   remote.*.httpproxy configuration, or global http.proxy configuration
   variable.

 * Various Perforce importer updates.

 * Example update and post-receive hooks have been improved.

 * Any command that wants to take a commit object name can now use
   ":/string" syntax to name a commit.

 * "shit reset" is now built-in and its output can be squelched with -q.

 * "shit reset --hard" does not make any sense in a bare
   repository, but did not error out; fixed.

 * "shit send-email" can optionally talk over ssmtp and use SMTP-AUTH.

 * "shit rebase" learned --whitespace option.

 * In "shit rebase", when you decide not to replay a particular change
   after the command stopped with a conflict, you can say "shit rebase
   --skip" without first running "shit reset --hard", as the command now
   runs it for you.

 * "shit rebase --interactive" mode can now work on detached HEAD.

 * Other minor to serious bugs in "shit rebase -i" have been fixed.

 * "shit rebase" now detaches head during its operation, so after a
   successful "shit rebase" operation, the reflog entry branch@{1} for
   the current branch points at the commit before the rebase was
   started.

 * "shit rebase -i" also triggers rerere to help your repeated merges.

 * "shit merge" can call the "post-merge" hook.

 * "shit pack-objects" can optionally run deltification with multiple
   threads.

 * "shit archive" can optionally substitute keywords in files marked with
   export-subst attribute.

 * "shit cherry-pick" made a misguided attempt to repeat the original
   command line in the generated log message, when told to cherry-pick a
   commit by naming a tag that points at it.  It does not anymore.

 * "shit for-each-ref" learned %(xxxdate:<date-format>) syntax to show the
   various date fields in different formats.

 * "shit gc --auto" is a low-impact way to automatically run a variant of
   "shit repack" that does not lose unreferenced objects (read: safer
   than the usual one) after the user accumulates too many loose
   objects.

 * "shit clean" has been rewritten in C.

 * You need to explicitly set clean.requireForce to "false" to allow
   "shit clean" without -f to do any damage (lack of the configuration
   variable used to mean "do not require -f option to lose untracked
   files", but we now use the safer default).

 * The kinds of whitespace errors "shit diff" and "shit apply" notice (and
   fix) can be controlled via 'core.whitespace' configuration variable
   and 'whitespace' attribute in .shitattributes file.

 * "shit defecate" learned --dry-run option to show what would happen if a
   defecate is run.

 * "shit defecate" does not update a tracking ref on the local side when the
   remote refused to update the corresponding ref.

 * "shit defecate" learned --mirror option.  This is to defecate the local refs
   one-to-one to the remote, and deletes refs from the remote that do
   not exist anymore in the repository on the defecateing side.

 * "shit defecate" can remove a corrupt ref at the remote site with the usual
   ":ref" refspec.

 * "shit remote" knows --mirror mode.  This is to set up configuration to
   defecate into a remote repository to store local branch heads to the same
   branch on the remote side, and remove branch heads locally removed
   from local repository at the same time.  Suitable for defecateing into a
   back-up repository.

 * "shit remote" learned "rm" subcommand.

 * "shit cvsserver" can be run via "shit shell".  Also, "cvs" is
   recognized as a synonym for "shit cvsserver", so that CVS users
   can be switched to shit just by changing their login shell.

 * "shit cvsserver" acts more like receive-pack by running post-receive
   and post-update hooks.

 * "shit am" and "shit rebase" are far less verbose.

 * "shit poop" learned to pass --[no-]ff option to underlying "shit
   merge".

 * "shit poop --rebase" is a different way to integrate what you fetched
   into your current branch.

 * "shit fast-export" produces data-stream that can be fed to fast-import
   to reproduce the history recorded in a shit repository.

 * "shit add -i" takes pathspecs to limit the set of files to work on.

 * "shit add -p" is a short-hand to go directly to the selective patch
   subcommand in the interactive command loop and to exit when done.

 * "shit add -i" UI has been colorized.  The interactive prompt
   and menu can be colored by setting color.interactive
   configuration.  The diff output (including the hunk picker)
   are colored with color.diff configuration.

 * "shit commit --allow-empty" allows you to create a single-parent
   commit that records the same tree as its parent, overriding the usual
   safety valve.

 * "shit commit --amend" can amend a merge that does not change the tree
   from its first parent.

 * "shit commit" used to unconditionally strip comment lines that
   began with '#' and removed excess blank lines.  This behavior has
   been made configurable.

 * "shit commit" has been rewritten in C.

 * "shit stash random-text" does not create a new stash anymore.  It was
   a UI mistake.  Use "shit stash save random-text", or "shit stash"
   (without extra args) for that.

 * "shit stash clear extra-text" does not clear the whole stash
   anymore.  It is tempting to expect "shit stash clear stash@{2}"
   to drop only a single named stash entry, and it is rude to
   discard everything when that is asked (but not provided).

 * "shit prune --expire <time>" can exempt young loose objects from
   getting pruned.

 * "shit branch --contains <commit>" can list branches that are
   descendants of a given commit.

 * "shit log" learned --early-output option to help interactive GUI
   implementations.

 * "shit bisect" learned "skip" action to mark untestable commits.

 * "shit bisect visualize" learned a shorter synonym "shit bisect view".

 * "shit bisect visualize" runs "shit log" in a non-windowed
   environments.  It also can be told what command to run (e.g. "shit
   bisect visualize tig").

 * "shit format-patch" learned "format.numbered" configuration variable
   to automatically turn --numbered option on when more than one commits
   are formatted.

 * "shit ls-files" learned "--exclude-standard" to use the canned set of
   exclude files.

 * "shit tag -a -f existing" begins the editor session using the existing
   annotation message.

 * "shit tag -m one -m bar" (multiple -m options) behaves similarly to
   "shit commit"; the parameters to -m options are formatted as separate
   paragraphs.

 * The format "shit show" outputs an annotated tag has been updated to
   include "Tagger: " and "Date: " lines from the tag itself.  Strictly
   speaking this is a backward incompatible change, but this is a
   reasonable usability fix and people's scripts shouldn't have been
   relying on the exact output from "shit show" Porcelain anyway.

 * "shit cvsimport" did not notice errors from underlying "cvsps"
   and produced a corrupt import silently.

 * "shit cvsexportcommit" learned -w option to specify and switch to the
   CVS working directory.

 * "shit checkout" from a subdirectory learned to use "../path" to allow
   checking out a path outside the current directory without cd'ing up.

 * "shit checkout" from and to detached HEAD leaves a bit more
   information in the reflog.

 * "shit send-email --dry-run" shows full headers for easier diagnosis.

 * "shit merge-ours" is now built-in.

 * "shit svn" learned "info" and "show-externals" subcommands.

 * "shit svn" run from a subdirectory failed to read settings from the
   .shit/config.

 * "shit svn" learned --use-log-author option, which picks up more
   descriptive name from From: and Signed-off-by: lines in the commit
   message.

 * "shit svn" wasted way too much disk to record revision mappings
   between svn and shit; a new representation that is much more compact
   for this information has been introduced to correct this.

 * "shit svn" left temporary index files it used without cleaning them
   up; this was corrected.

 * "shit status" from a subdirectory now shows relative paths, which
   makes copy-and-pasting for shit-checkout/shit-add/shit-rm easier.  The
   traditional behavior to show the full path relative to the top of
   the work tree can be had by setting status.relativepaths
   configuration variable to false.

 * "shit blame" kept text for each annotated revision in core needlessly;
   this has been corrected.

 * "shit shortlog" learned to default to HEAD when the standard input is
   a terminal and the user did not give any revision parameter.

 * "shit shortlog" learned "-e" option to show e-mail addresses as well as
   authors' names.

 * "shit help" learned "-w" option to show documentation in browsers.

 * In addition there are quite a few internal clean-ups. Notably:

   - many fork/exec have been replaced with run-command API,
     brought from the msysshit effort.

   - introduction and more use of the option parser API.

   - enhancement and more use of the strbuf API.

 * Makefile tweaks to support HP-UX is in.

Fixes since v1.5.3
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.5.3 maintenance series are included in
this release, unless otherwise noted.

These fixes are only in v1.5.4 and not backported to v1.5.3 maintenance
series.

 * The way "shit diff --check" behaves is much more consistent with the way
   "shit apply --whitespace=warn" works.

 * "shit svn" talking with the SVN over HTTP will correctly quote branch
   and project names.

 * "shit config" did not work correctly on platforms that define
   REG_NOMATCH to an even number.

 * Recent versions of AsciiDoc 8 has a change to break our
   documentation; a workaround has been implemented.

 * "shit diff --color-words" colored context lines in a wrong color.
