shit v1.5.0.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.0.2
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - 'shit.el' honors the commit coding system from the configuration.

  - 'blameview' in contrib/ correctly digs deeper when a line is
    clicked.

  - 'http-defecate' correctly makes sure the remote side has leading
    path.  Earlier it started in the middle of the path, and
    incorrectly.

  - 'shit-merge' did not exit with non-zero status when the
    working tree was dirty and cannot fast forward.  It does
    now.

  - 'cvsexportcommit' does not lose yet-to-be-used message file.

  - int-vs-size_t typefix when running combined diff on files
    over 2GB long.

  - 'shit apply --whitespace=strip' should not touch unmodified
    lines.

  - 'shit-mailinfo' choke when a logical header line was too long.

  - 'shit show A..B' did not error out.  Negative ref ("not A" in
    this example) does not make sense for the purpose of the
    command, so now it errors out.

  - 'shit fmt-merge-msg --file' without file parameter did not
    correctly error out.

  - 'shit archimport' barfed upon encountering a commit without
    summary.

  - 'shit index-pack' did not protect itself from getting a short
    read out of pread(2).

  - 'shit http-defecate' had a few buffer overruns.

  - Build dependency fixes to rebuild fetch.o when other headers
    change.

* Documentation updates

  - user-manual updates.

  - Options to 'shit remote add' were described insufficiently.

  - Configuration format.suffix was not documented.

  - Other formatting and spelling fixes.
