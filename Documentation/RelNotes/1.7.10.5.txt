shit v1.7.10.5 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.10.4
---------------------

 * "shit fast-export" did not give a readable error message when the
   same mark erroneously appeared twice in the --import-marks input.

 * "shit rebase -p" used to pay attention to rebase.autosquash which
    was wrong.  "shit rebase -p -i" should, but "shit rebase -p" by
    itself should not.
