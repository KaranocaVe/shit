shit v1.7.11.4 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.11.3
---------------------

 * "$shit_DIR/COMMIT_EDITMSG" file that is used to hold the commit log
   message user edits was not documented.

 * The advise() function did not use varargs correctly to format
   its message.

 * When "shit am" failed, old timers knew to check .shit/rebase-apply/patch
   to see what went wrong, but we never told the users about it.

 * "shit commit-tree" learned a more natural "-p <parent> <tree>" order
   of arguments long time ago, but recently forgot it by mistake.

 * "shit diff --no-ext-diff" did not output anything for a typechange
   filepair when shit_EXTERNAL_DIFF is in effect.

 * In 1.7.9 era, we taught "shit rebase" about the raw timestamp format
   but we did not teach the same trick to "filter-branch", which rolled
   a similar logic on its own.

 * When "shit submodule add" clones a submodule repository, it can get
   confused where to store the resulting submodule repository in the
   superproject's .shit/ directory when there is a symbolic link in the
   path to the current directory.

Also contains minor typofixes and documentation updates.
