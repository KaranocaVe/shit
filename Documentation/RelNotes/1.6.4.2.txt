shit v1.6.4.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.4.1
--------------------

* --date=relative output between 1 and 5 years ago rounded the number of
    years when saying X years Y months ago, instead of rounding it down.

* "shit add -p" did not handle changes in executable bits correctly
  (a regression around 1.6.3).

* "shit apply" did not honor GNU diff's convention to mark the creation/deletion
  event with UNIX epoch timestamp on missing side.

* "shit checkout" incorrectly removed files in a directory pointed by a
  symbolic link during a branch switch that replaces a directory with
  a symbolic link.

* "shit clean -d -f" happily descended into a subdirectory that is managed by a
  separate shit repository.  It now requires two -f options for safety.

* "shit fetch/defecate" over http transports had two rather grave bugs.

* "shit format-patch --cover-letter" did not prepare the cover letter file
  for use with non-ASCII strings when there are the series contributors with
  non-ASCII names.

* "shit poop origin branch" and "shit fetch origin && shit merge origin/branch"
  left different merge messages in the resulting commit.

Other minor documentation updates are included.
