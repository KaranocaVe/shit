shit v1.7.4.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.4.2
--------------------

 * "shit apply" used to confuse lines updated by previous hunks as lines
   that existed before when applying a hunk, contributing misapplication
   of patches with offsets.

 * "shit branch --track" (and "shit checkout --track --branch") used to
   allow setting up a random non-branch that does not make sense to follow
   as the "upstream".  The command correctly diagnoses it as an error.

 * "shit checkout $other_branch" silently removed untracked symbolic links
   in the working tree that are in the way in order to check out paths
   under it from the named branch.

 * "shit cvsimport" did not bail out immediately when the cvs server cannot
   be reached, spewing unnecessary error messages that complain about the
   server response that it never got.

 * "shit diff --quiet" did not work very well with the "--diff-filter"
   option.

 * "shit grep -n" lacked a long-hand synonym --line-number.

 * "shit stash apply" reported the result of its operation by running
   "shit status" from the top-level of the working tree; it should (and
   now does) run it from the user's working directory.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
