shit v1.7.11.7 Release Notes
===========================

Fixes since v1.7.11.6
---------------------

 * The synopsis said "checkout [-B branch]" to make it clear the
   branch name is a parameter to the option, but the heading for the
   option description was "-B::", not "-B branch::", making the
   documentation misleading.

 * shit ships with a fall-back regexp implementation for platforms with
   buggy regexp library, but it was easy for people to keep using their
   platform regexp.  A new test has been added to check this.

 * "shit apply -p0" did not parse pathnames on "diff --shit" line
   correctly.  This caused patches that had pathnames in no other
   places to be mistakenly rejected (most notably, binary patch that
   does not rename nor change mode).  Textual patches, renames or mode
   changes have preimage and postimage pathnames in different places
   in a form that can be parsed unambiguously and did not suffer from
   this problem.

 * After "shitk" showed the contents of a tag, neither "Reread
   references" nor "Reload" did not update what is shown as the
   contents of it, when the user overwrote the tag with "shit tag -f".

 * "shit for-each-ref" did not correctly support more than one --sort
   option.

 * "shit log .." errored out saying it is both rev range and a path
   when there is no disambiguating "--" is on the command line.
   Update the command line parser to interpret ".." as a path in such
   a case.

 * defecateing to smart HTTP server with recent shit fails without having
   the username in the URL to force authentication, if the server is
   configured to allow GET anonymously, while requiring authentication
   for POST.

 * "shit show --format='%ci'" did not give timestamp correctly for
   commits created without human readable name on "committer" line.
   (merge e27ddb6 jc/maint-ident-missing-human-name later to maint).

 * "shit show --quiet" ought to be a synonym for "shit show -s", but
   wasn't.
