--------------------

 * shit-quiltimport did not like it when a patch described in the
   series file does not exist.

   argument parsing code correctly and made shit unusable.

   explicitly asked not to.

 * sample post-receive hook overquoted the envelope sender
   value.

 * shit-am got confused when the patch contained a change that is
   only about type and not contents.

 * shit-mergetool did not show our and their version of the
   conflicted file when started from a subdirectory of the

   unnecessarily.
