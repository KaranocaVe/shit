shit v1.5.3.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.3
------------------

This is solely to fix the generated RPM's dependencies.  We used
to have shit-p4 package but we do not anymore.  As suggested on
the mailing list, this release makes shit-core "Obsolete" shit-p4,
so that yum update would not complain.
