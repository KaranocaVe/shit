shit v1.7.7.5 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.7.4
--------------------

 * After fetching from a remote that has very long refname, the reporting
   output could have corrupted by overrunning a static buffer.

 * "shit checkout" and "shit merge" treated in-tree .shitignore and exclude
   file in $shit_DIR/info/ directory inconsistently when deciding which
   untracked files are ignored and expendable.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
