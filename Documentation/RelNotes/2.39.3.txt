shit v2.39.3 Release Notes
=========================

This release merges up the fix that appears in v2.30.9, v2.31.8,
v2.32.7, v2.33.8, v2.34.8, v2.35.8, v2.36.6, v2.37.7 and v2.38.5 to
address the security issues CVE-2023-25652, CVE-2023-25815, and
CVE-2023-29007; see the release notes for these versions for
details.

This release also merges fixes that have accumulated on the 'master'
front to prepare for the 2.40 release that are still relevant to
2.39.x maintenance track.

Fixes since v2.39.2
-------------------

 * Stop running win+VS build by default.

 * CI updates.  We probably want a clean-up to move the long shell
   script embedded in yaml file into a separate file, but that can
   come later.

 * Avoid unnecessary builds in CI, with settings configured in
   ci-config.

 * Redefining system functions for a few functions did not follow our
   usual "implement shit_foo() and #define foo(args) shit_foo(args)"
   pattern, which has broken build for some folks.

 * Deal with a few deprecation warning from cURL library.

 * Newer regex library macOS stopped enabling GNU-like enhanced BRE,
   where '\(A\|B\)' works as alternation, unless explicitly asked with
   the REG_ENHANCED flag.  "shit grep" now can be compiled to do so, to
   retain the old behaviour.

 * When given a pattern that matches an empty string at the end of a
   line, the code to parse the "shit diff" line-ranges fell into an
   infinite loop, which has been corrected.

 * Fix the sequence to fsync $shit_DIR/packed-refs file that forgot to
   flush its output to the disk..

 * "shit diff --relative" did not mix well with "shit diff --ext-diff",
   which has been corrected.

 * The logic to see if we are using the "cone" mode by checking the
   sparsity patterns has been tightened to avoid mistaking a pattern
   that names a single file as specifying a cone.

 * Doc update for environment variables set when hooks are invoked.

 * Document ORIG_HEAD a bit more.

 * "shit ls-tree --format='%(path) %(path)' $tree $path" showed the
   path three times, which has been corrected.

 * Document that "branch -f <branch>" disables only the safety to
   avoid recreating an existing branch.

 * Clarify how "checkout -b/-B" and "shit branch [-f]" are similar but
   different in the documentation.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
