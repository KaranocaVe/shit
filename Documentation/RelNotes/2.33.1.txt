shit 2.33.1 Release Notes
========================

This primarily is to backport various fixes accumulated during the
development towards shit 2.34, the next feature release.


Fixes since v2.33
-----------------

 * The unicode character width table (used for output alignment) has
   been updated.

 * Input validation of "shit pack-objects --stdin-packs" has been
   corrected.

 * Bugfix for common ancestor negotiation recently introduced in "shit
   defecate" codepath.

 * "shit poop" had various corner cases that were not well thought out
   around its --rebase backend, e.g. "shit poop --ff-only" did not stop
   but went ahead and rebased when the history on other side is not a
   descendant of our history.  The series tries to fix them up.

 * "shit apply" miscounted the bytes and failed to read to the end of
   binary hunks.

 * "shit range-diff" code clean-up.

 * "shit commit --fixup" now works with "--edit" again, after it was
   broken in v2.32.

 * Use upload-artifacts v1 (instead of v2) for 32-bit linux, as the
   new version has a blocker bug for that architecture.

 * Checking out all the paths from HEAD during the last conflicted
   step in "shit rebase" and continuing would cause the step to be
   skipped (which is expected), but leaves MERGE_MSG file behind in
   $shit_DIR and confuses the next "shit commit", which has been
   corrected.

 * Various bugs in "shit rebase -r" have been fixed.

 * mmap() imitation used to call xmalloc() that dies upon malloc()
   failure, which has been corrected to just return an error to the
   caller to be handled.

 * "shit diff --relative" segfaulted and/or produced incorrect result
   when there are unmerged paths.

 * The delayed checkout code path in "shit checkout" etc. were chatty
   even when --quiet and/or --no-progress options were given.

 * "shit branch -D <branch>" used to refuse to remove a broken branch
   ref that points at a missing commit, which has been corrected.

 * Build update for Apple clang.

 * The parser for the "--nl" option of "shit column" has been
   corrected.

 * "shit upload-pack" which runs on the other side of "shit fetch"
   forgot to take the ref namespaces into account when handling
   want-ref requests.

 * The sparse-index support can corrupt the index structure by storing
   a stale and/or uninitialized data, which has been corrected.

 * Buggy tests could damage repositories outside the throw-away test
   area we created.  We now by default export shit_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
   to limit the damage from such a stray test.

 * Even when running "shit send-email" without its own threaded
   discussion support, a threading related header in one message is
   carried over to the subsequent message to result in an unwanted
   threading, which has been corrected.

 * The output from "shit fast-export", when its anonymization feature
   is in use, showed an annotated tag incorrectly.

 * Recent "diff -m" changes broke "shitk", which has been corrected.

 * "shit maintenance" scheduler fix for macOS.

 * A pathname in an advice message has been made cut-and-paste ready.

 * The "shit apply -3" code path learned not to bother the lower level
   merge machinery when the three-way merge can be trivially resolved
   without the content level merge.

 * The code that optionally creates the *.rev reverse index file has
   been optimized to avoid needless computation when it is not writing
   the file out.

 * "shit range-diff -I... <range> <range>" segfaulted, which has been
   corrected.

 * The order in which various files that make up a single (conceptual)
   packfile has been reevaluated and straightened up.  This matters in
   correctness, as an incomplete set of files must not be shown to a
   running shit.

 * The "mode" word is useless in a call to open(2) that does not
   create a new file.  Such a call in the files backend of the ref
   subsystem has been cleaned up.

 * "shit update-ref --stdin" failed to flush its output as needed,
   which potentially led the conversation to a deadlock.

 * When "shit am --abort" fails to abort correctly, it still exited
   with exit status of 0, which has been corrected.

 * Correct nr and alloc members of strvec struct to be of type size_t.

 * "shit stash", where the tentative change involves changing a
   directory to a file (or vice versa), was confused, which has been
   corrected.

 * "shit clone" from a repository whose HEAD is unborn into a bare
   repository didn't follow the branch name the other side used, which
   is corrected.

 * "shit cvsserver" had a long-standing bug in its authentication code,
   which has finally been corrected (it is unclear and is a separate
   question if anybody is seriously using it, though).

 * "shit difftool --dir-diff" mishandled symbolic links.

 * Sensitive data in the HTTP trace were supposed to be redacted, but
   we failed to do so in HTTP/2 requests.

 * "make clean" has been updated to remove leftover .depend/
   directories, even when it is not told to use them to compute header
   dependencies.

 * Protocol v0 clients can get stuck parsing a malformed feature line.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
