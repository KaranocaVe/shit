shit v1.8.5.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.8.5.1
--------------------

 * "shit diff -- ':(icase)makefile'" was unnecessarily rejected at the
   command line parser.

 * "shit cat-file --batch-check=ok" did not check the existence of
   the named object.

 * "shit am --abort" sometimes complained about not being able to write
   a tree with an 0{40} object in it.

 * Two processes creating loose objects at the same time could have
   failed unnecessarily when the name of their new objects started
   with the same byte value, due to a race condition.

Also contains typofixes, documentation updates and trivial code clean-ups.
