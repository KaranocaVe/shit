shit v1.5.4.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.4.3
--------------------

 * Building and installing with an overtight umask such as 077 made
   installed templates unreadable by others, while the rest of the install
   are done in a way that is friendly to umask 022.

 * "shit cvsexportcommit -w $cvsdir" misbehaved when shit_DIR is set to a
   relative directory.

 * "shit http-defecate" had an invalid memory access that could lead it to
   segfault.

 * When "shit rebase -i" gave control back to the user for a commit that is
   marked to be edited, it just said "modify it with commit --amend",
   without saying what to do to continue after modifying it.  Give an
   explicit instruction to run "rebase --continue" to be more helpful.

 * "shit send-email" in 1.5.4.3 issued a bogus empty In-Reply-To: header.

 * "shit bisect" showed mysterious "won't bisect on seeked tree" error message.
   This was leftover from Coshito days to prevent "bisect" starting from a
   cg-seeked state.  We still keep the Coshito safety, but running "shit bisect
   start" when another bisect was in effect will clean up and start over.

 * "shit defecate" with an explicit PATH to receive-pack did not quite work if
   receive-pack was not on usual PATH.  We earlier fixed the same issue
   with "shit fetch" and upload-pack, but somehow forgot to do so in the
   other direction.

 * shit-gui's info dialog was not displayed correctly when the user tries
   to commit nothing (i.e. without staging anything).

 * "shit revert" did not properly fail when attempting to run with a
   dirty index.

 * "shit merge --no-commit --no-ff <other>" incorrectly made commits.

 * "shit merge --squash --no-ff <other>", which is a nonsense combination
   of options, was not rejected.

 * "shit ls-remote" and "shit remote show" against an empty repository
   failed, instead of just giving an empty result (regression).

 * "shit fast-import" did not handle a renamed path whose name needs to be
   quoted, due to a bug in unquote_c_style() function.

 * "shit cvsexportcommit" was confused when multiple files with the same
   basename needed to be defecateed out in the same commit.

 * "shit daemon" did not send early errors to syslog.

 * "shit log --merge" did not work well with --left-right option.

 * "shit svn" prompted for client cert password every time it accessed the
   server.

 * The reset command in "shit fast-import" data stream was documented to
   end with an optional LF, but it actually required one.

 * "shit svn dcommit/rebase" did not honor --rewrite-root option.

Also included are a handful documentation updates.
