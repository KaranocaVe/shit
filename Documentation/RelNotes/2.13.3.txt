shit v2.13.3 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.13.2
-------------------

 * The "collision detecting" SHA-1 implementation shipped with 2.13.2
   was still broken on some platforms.  Update to the upstream code
   again to take their fix.

 * The 'diff-highlight' program (in contrib/) has been restructured
   for easier reuse by an external project 'diff-so-fancy'.

 * "shit mergetool" learned to work around a wrapper MacOS X adds
   around underlying meld.

 * An example in documentation that does not work in multi worktree
   configuration has been corrected.

 * The pretty-format specifiers like '%h', '%t', etc. had an
   optimization that no longer works correctly.  In preparation/hope
   of getting it correctly implemented, first discard the optimization
   that is broken.

 * The code to pick up and execute command alias definition from the
   configuration used to switch to the top of the working tree and
   then come back when the expanded alias was executed, which was
   unnecessarily complex.  Attempt to simplify the logic by using the
   early-config mechanism that does not chdir around.

 * "shit add -p" were updated in 2.12 timeframe to cope with custom
   core.commentchar but the implementation was buggy and a
   metacharacter like $ and * did not work.

 * Fix a recent regression to "shit rebase -i" and add tests that would
   have caught it and others.

 * An unaligned 32-bit access in pack-bitmap code has been corrected.

 * Tighten error checks for invalid "shit apply" input.

 * The split index code did not honor core.sharedrepository setting
   correctly.

 * The Makefile rule in contrib/subtree for building documentation
   learned to honour USE_ASCIIDOCTOR just like the main documentation
   set does.

 * A few tests that tried to verify the contents of defecate certificates
   did not use 'shit rev-parse' to formulate the line to look for in
   the certificate correctly.

 * After "shit branch --move" of the currently checked out branch, the
   code to walk the reflog of HEAD via "log -g" and friends
   incorrectly stopped at the reflog entry that records the renaming
   of the branch.

 * The rewrite of "shit branch --list" using for-each-ref's internals
   that happened in v2.13 regressed its handling of color.branch.local;
   this has been fixed.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
