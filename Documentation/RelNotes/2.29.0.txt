shit 2.29 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.28
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "shit help log" has been enhanced by sharing more material from the
   documentation for the underlying "shit rev-list" command.

 * "shit for-each-ref --format=<>" learned %(contents:size).

 * "shit merge" learned to selectively omit " into <branch>" at the end
   of the title of default merge message with merge.suppressDest
   configuration.

 * The component to respond to "shit fetch" request is made more
   configurable to selectively allow or reject object filtering
   specification used for partial cloning.

 * Stop when "sendmail.*" configuration variables are defined, which
   could be a mistaken attempt to define "sendemail.*" variables.

 * The existing backends for "shit mergetool" based on variants of vim
   have been refactored and then support for "nvim" has been added.

 * "shit bisect" learns the "--first-parent" option to find the first
   breakage along the first-parent chain.

 * "shit log --first-parent -p" showed patches only for single-parent
   commits on the first-parent chain; the "--first-parent" option has
   been made to imply "-m".  Use "--no-diff-merges" to restore the
   previous behaviour to omit patches for merge commits.

 * The commit labels used to explain each side of conflicted hunks
   placed by the sequencer machinery have been made more readable by
   humans.

 * The "--batch-size" option of "shit multi-pack-index repack" command
   is now used to specify that very small packfiles are collected into
   one until the total size roughly exceeds it.

 * The recent addition of SHA-256 support is marked as experimental in
   the documentation.

 * "shit fetch" learned --no-write-fetch-head option to avoid writing
   the FETCH_HEAD file.

 * Command line completion (in contrib/) usually omits redundant,
   deprecated and/or dangerous options from its output; it learned to
   optionally include all of them.

 * The output from the "diff" family of the commands had abbreviated
   object names of blobs involved in the patch, but its length was not
   affected by the --abbrev option.  Now it is.

 * "shit worktree" gained a "repair" subcommand to help users recover
   after moving the worktrees or repository manually without telling
   shit.  Also, "shit init --separate-shit-dir" no longer corrupts
   administrative data related to linked worktrees.

 * The "--format=" option to the "for-each-ref" command and friends
   learned a few more tricks, e.g. the ":short" suffix that applies to
   "objectname" now also can be used for "parent", "tree", etc.

 * "shit worktree add" learns that the "-d" is a synonym to "--detach"
   option to create a new worktree without being on a branch.

 * "format-patch --range-diff=<prev> <origin>..HEAD" has been taught
   not to ignore <origin> when <prev> is a single version.

 * "add -p" now allows editing paths that were only added in intent.

 * The 'meld' backend of the "shit mergetool" learned to give the
   underlying 'meld' the '--auto-merge' option, which would help
   reduce the amount of text that requires manual merging.

 * "shit for-each-ref" and friends that list refs used to allow only
   one --merged or --no-merged to filter them; they learned to take
   combination of both kind of filtering.

 * "shit maintenance", a "shit gc"'s big brother, has been introduced to
   take care of more repository maintenance tasks, not limited to the
   object database cleaning.

 * "shit receive-pack" that accepts requests by "shit defecate" learned to
   outsource most of the ref updates to the new "proc-receive" hook.

 * "shit defecate" that wants to be atomic and wants to send defecate
   certificate learned not to prepare and sign the defecate certificate
   when it fails the local check (hence due to atomicity it is known
   that no certificate is needed).

 * "shit commit-graph write" learned to limit the number of bloom
   filters that are computed from scratch with the --max-new-filters
   option.

 * The transport protocol v2 has become the default again.

 * The installation procedure learned to optionally omit "shit-foo"
   executable files for each 'foo' built-in subcommand, which are only
   required by old timers that still rely on the age old promise that
   prepending "shit --exec-path" output to PATH early in their script
   will keep the "shit-foo" calls they wrote working.

 * The command line completion (in contrib/) learned that "shit restore
   -s <TAB>" is often followed by a refname.

 * "shit shortlog" has been taught to group commits by the contents of
   the trailer lines, like "Reviewed-by:", "Coauthored-by:", etc.

 * "shit archive" learns the "--add-file" option to include untracked
   files into a snapshot from a tree-ish.

 * "shit fetch" and "shit defecate" support negative refspecs.

 * "shit format-patch" learns to take "whenAble" as a possible value
   for the format.useAutoBase configuration variable to become no-op
   when the  automatically computed base does not make sense.

 * Credential helpers are now allowed to terminate lines with CRLF
   line ending, as well as LF line ending.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * The changed-path Bloom filter is improved using ideas from an
   independent implementation.

 * Updates to the changed-paths bloom filter.

 * The test framework has been updated so that most tests will run
   with predictable (artificial) timestamps.

 * Preliminary clean-up of the refs API in preparation for adding a
   new refs backend "reftable".

 * Dev support to limit the use of test_must_fail to only shit commands.

 * While packing many objects in a repository with a promissor remote,
   lazily fetching missing objects from the promissor remote one by
   one may be inefficient---the code now attempts to fetch all the
   missing objects in batch (obviously this won't work for a lazy
   clone that lazily fetches tree objects as you cannot even enumerate
   what blobs are missing until you learn which trees are missing).

 * The pretend-object mechanism checks if the given object already
   exists in the object store before deciding to keep the data
   in-core, but the check would have triggered lazy fetching of such
   an object from a promissor remote.

 * The argv_array API is useful for not just managing argv but any
   "vector" (NULL-terminated array) of strings, and has seen adoption
   to a certain degree.  It has been renamed to "strvec" to reduce the
   barrier to adoption.

 * The final leg of SHA-256 transition plus doc updates.  Note that
   there is no interoperability between SHA-1 and SHA-256
   repositories yet.

 * CMake support to build with MSVC for Windows bypassing the Makefile.

 * A new helper function has_object() has been introduced to make it
   easier to mark object existence checks that do and don't want to
   trigger lazy fetches, and a few such checks are converted using it.

 * A no-op replacement function implemented as a C preprocessor macro
   does not perform as good a job as one implemented as a "static
   inline" function in catching errors in parameters; replace the
   former with the latter in <shit-compat-util.h> header.

 * Test framework update.
   (merge d572f52a64 es/test-cmp-typocatcher later to maint).

 * Updates to "shit merge" tests, in preparation for a new merge
   strategy backend.

 * midx and commit-graph files now use the byte defined in their file
   format specification for identifying the hash function used for
   object names.

 * The FETCH_HEAD is now always read from the filesystem regardless of
   the ref backend in use, as its format is much richer than the
   normal refs, and written directly by "shit fetch" as a plain file..

 * An unused binary has been discarded, and a bunch of commands
   have been turned into built-in.

 * A handful of places in in-tree code still relied on being able to
   execute the shit subcommands, especially built-ins, in "shit-foo"
   form, which have been corrected.

 * When a packfile is removed by "shit repack", multi-pack-index gets
   cleared; the code was taught to do so less aggressively by first
   checking if the midx actually refers to a pack that no longer
   exists.

 * Internal API clean-up to handle two options "diff-index" and "log"
   have, which happen to share the same short form, more sensibly.

 * The "add -i/-p" machinery has been written in C but it is not used
   by default yet.  It is made default to those who are participating
   in feature.experimental experiment.

 * Allow maintainers to tweak $(TAR) invocations done while making
   distribution tarballs.

 * "shit index-pack" learned to resolve deltified objects with greater
   parallelism.

 * "diff-highlight" (in contrib/) had a logic to flush its output upon
   seeing a blank line but the way it detected a blank line was broken.

 * The logic to skip testing on the tagged commit and the tag itself
   was not quite consistent which led to failure of Windows test
   tasks.  It has been revamped to consistently skip revisions that
   have already been tested, based on the tree object of the revision.


Fixes since v2.28
-----------------

 * The "mediawiki" remote backend which lives in contrib/mw-to-shit/
   and is not built with shit by default, had an RCE bug allowing a
   malicious MediaWiki server operator to inject arbitrary commands
   for execution by a cloning client. This has been fixed.

   The bug was discovered and reported by Joern Schneeweisz of shitLab
   to the shit-security mailing list. Its practical impact due to the
   obscurity of shit-remote-mediawiki was deemed small enough to forgo
   a dedicated security release.

 * "shit clone --separate-shit-dir=$elsewhere" used to stomp on the
   contents of the existing directory $elsewhere, which has been
   taught to fail when $elsewhere is not an empty directory.
   (merge dfaa209a79 bw/fail-cloning-into-non-empty later to maint).

 * With the base fix to 2.27 regresion, any new extensions in a v0
   repository would still be silently honored, which is not quite
   right.  Instead, complain and die loudly.
   (merge ec91ffca04 jk/reject-newer-extensions-in-v0 later to maint).

 * Fetching from a lazily cloned repository resulted at the server
   side in attempts to lazy fetch objects that the client side has,
   many of which will not be available from the third-party anyway.
   (merge 77aa0941ce jt/avoid-lazy-fetching-upon-have-check later to maint).

 * Fix to an ancient bug caused by an over-eager attempt for
   optimization.
   (merge a98f7fb366 rs/add-index-entry-optim-fix later to maint).

 * defecateing a ref whose name contains non-ASCII character with the
   "--force-with-lease" option did not work over smart HTTP protocol,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge cd85b447bf bc/defecate-cas-cquoted-refname later to maint).

 * "shit mv src dst", when src is an unmerged path, errored out
   correctly but with an incorrect error message to claim that src is
   not tracked, which has been clarified.
   (merge 9b906af657 ct/mv-unmerged-path-error later to maint).

 * Fix to a regression introduced during 2.27 cycle.
   (merge cada7308ad en/fill-directory-exponential later to maint).

 * Command line completion (in contrib/) update.
   (merge 688b87c81b mp/complete-show-color-moved later to maint).

 * All "mergy" operations that internally use the merge-recursive
   machinery should honor the merge.renormalize configuration, but
   many of them didn't.

 * Doc cleanup around "worktree".
   (merge dc9c144be5 es/worktree-doc-cleanups later to maint).

 * The "shit blame --first-parent" option was not documented, but now
   it is.
   (merge 11bc12ae1e rp/blame-first-parent-doc later to maint).

 * The logic to find the ref transaction hook script attempted to
   cache the path to the found hook without realizing that it needed
   to keep a copied value, as the API it used returned a transitory
   buffer space.  This has been corrected.
   (merge 09b2aa30c9 ps/ref-transaction-hook later to maint).

 * Recent versions of "shit diff-files" shows a diff between the index
   and the working tree for "intent-to-add" paths as a "new file"
   patch; "shit apply --cached" should be able to take "shit diff-files"
   and should act as an equivalent to "shit add" for the path, but the
   command failed to do so for such a path.
   (merge 4c025c667e rp/apply-cached-with-i-t-a later to maint).

 * "shit diff [<tree-ish>] $path" for a $path that is marked with i-t-a
   bit was not showing the mode bits from the working tree.
   (merge cb0dd22b82 rp/ita-diff-modefix later to maint).

 * Ring buffer with size 4 used for bin-hex translation resulted in a
   wrong object name in the sequencer's todo output, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 5da69c0dac ak/sequencer-fix-find-uniq-abbrev later to maint).

 * When given more than one target line ranges, "shit blame -La,b
   -Lc,d" was over-eager to coalesce groups of original lines and
   showed incorrect results, which has been corrected.
   (merge c2ebaa27d6 jk/blame-coalesce-fix later to maint).

 * The regexp to identify the function boundary for FORTRAN programs
   has been updated.
   (merge 75c3b6b2e8 pb/userdiff-fortran-update later to maint).

 * A few end-user facing messages have been updated to be
   hash-algorithm agnostic.
   (merge 4279000d3e jc/object-names-are-not-sha-1 later to maint).

 * "unlink" emulation on MinGW has been optimized.
   (merge 680e0b4524 jh/mingw-unlink later to maint).

 * The purpose of "shit init --separate-shit-dir" is to initialize a
   new project with the repository separate from the working tree,
   or, in the case of an existing project, to move the repository
   (the .shit/ directory) out of the working tree. It does not make
   sense to use --separate-shit-dir with a bare repository for which
   there is no working tree, so disallow its use with bare
   repositories.
   (merge ccf236a23a es/init-no-separate-shit-dir-in-bare later to maint).

 * "ls-files -o" mishandled the top-level directory of another shit
   working tree that hangs in the current shit working tree.
   (merge ab282aa548 en/dir-nonbare-embedded later to maint).

 * Fix some incorrect UNLEAK() annotations.
   (merge 3e19816dc0 jk/unleak-fixes later to maint).

 * Use more buffered I/O where we used to call many small write(2)s.
   (merge a698d67b08 rs/more-buffered-io later to maint).

 * The patch-id computation did not ignore the "incomplete last line"
   marker like whitespaces.
   (merge 82a62015a7 rs/patch-id-with-incomplete-line later to maint).

 * Updates into a lazy/partial clone with a submodule did not work
   well with transfer.fsckobjects set.

 * The parser for "shit for-each-ref --format=..." was too loose when
   parsing the "%(trailers...)" atom, and forgot that "trailers" and
   "trailers:<modifiers>" are the only two allowed forms, which has
   been corrected.
   (merge 2c22e102f8 hv/ref-filter-trailers-atom-parsing-fix later to maint).

 * Long ago, we decided to use 3 threads by default when running the
   index-pack task in parallel, which has been adjusted a bit upwards.
   (merge fbff95b67f jk/index-pack-w-more-threads later to maint).

 * "shit restore/checkout --no-overlay" with wildcarded pathspec
   mistakenly removed matching paths in subdirectories, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge bfda204ade rs/checkout-no-overlay-pathspec-fix later to maint).

 * The description of --cached/--index options in "shit apply --help"
   has been updated.
   (merge d064702be3 rp/apply-cached-doc later to maint).

 * Feeding "$ZERO_OID" to "shit log --ignore-missing --stdin", and
   running "shit log --ignore-missing $ZERO_OID" fell back to start
   digging from HEAD; it has been corrected to become a no-op, like
   "shit log --tags=no-tag-matches-this-pattern" does.
   (merge 04a0e98515 jk/rev-input-given-fix later to maint).

 * Various callers of run_command API have been modernized.
   (merge afbdba391e jc/run-command-use-embedded-args later to maint).

 * List of options offered and accepted by "shit add -i/-p" were
   inconsistent, which have been corrected.
   (merge ce910287e7 pw/add-p-allowed-options-fix later to maint).

 * "shit diff --stat -w" showed 0-line changes for paths whose changes
   were only whitespaces, which was not intuitive.  We now omit such
   paths from the stat output.
   (merge 1cf3d5db9b mr/diff-hide-stat-wo-textual-change later to maint).

 * It was possible for xrealloc() to send a non-NULL pointer that has
   been freed, which has been fixed.
   (merge 6479ea4a8a jk/xrealloc-avoid-use-after-free later to maint).

 * "shit status" has trouble showing where it came from by interpreting
   reflog entries that record certain events, e.g. "checkout @{u}", and
   gives a hard/fatal error.  Even though it inherently is impossible
   to give a correct answer because the reflog entries lose some
   information (e.g. "@{u}" does not record what branch the user was
   on hence which branch 'the upstream' needs to be computed, and even
   if the record were available, the relationship between branches may
   have changed), at least hide the error and allow "status" to show its
   output.

 * "shit status --short" quoted a path with SP in it when tracked, but
   not those that are untracked, ignored or unmerged.  They are all
   shown quoted consistently.

 * "shit diff/show" on a change that involves a submodule used to read
   the information on commits in the submodule from a wrong repository
   and gave a wrong information when the commit-graph is involved.
   (merge 85a1ec2c32 mf/submodule-summary-with-correct-repository later to maint).

 * Unlike "shit config --local", "shit config --worktree" did not fail
   early and cleanly when started outside a shit repository.
   (merge 378fe5fc3d mt/config-fail-nonshit-early later to maint).

 * There is a logic to estimate how many objects are in the
   repository, which is meant to run once per process invocation, but
   it ran every time the estimated value was requested.
   (merge 67bb65de5d jk/dont-count-existing-objects-twice later to maint).

 * "shit remote set-head" that failed still said something that hints
   the operation went through, which was misleading.
   (merge 5a07c6c3c2 cs/don-t-pretend-a-failed-remote-set-head-succeeded later to maint).

 * "shit fetch --all --ipv4/--ipv6" forgot to pass the protocol options
   to instances of the "shit fetch" that talk to individual remotes,
   which has been corrected.
   (merge 4e735c1326 ar/fetch-ipversion-in-all later to maint).

 * The "unshelve" subcommand of "shit p4" incorrectly used commit^N
   where it meant to say commit~N to name the Nth generation
   ancestor, which has been corrected.
   (merge 0acbf5997f ld/p4-unshelve-fix later to maint).

 * "shit clone" that clones from SHA-1 repository, while
   shit_DEFAULT_HASH set to use SHA-256 already, resulted in an
   unusable repository that half-claims to be SHA-256 repository
   with SHA-1 objects and refs.  This has been corrected.

 * Adjust sample hooks for hash algorithm other than SHA-1.
   (merge d8d3d632f4 dl/zero-oid-in-hooks later to maint).

 * "shit range-diff" showed incorrect diffstat, which has been
   corrected.

 * Earlier we taught "shit poop" to warn when the user does not say the
   histories need to be merged, rebased or accepts only fast-
   forwarding, but the warning triggered for those who have set the
   poop.ff configuration variable.
   (merge 54200cef86 ah/poop later to maint).

 * Compilation fix around type punning.
   (merge 176380fd11 jk/drop-unaligned-loads later to maint).

 * "shit blame --ignore-rev/--ignore-revs-file" failed to validate
   their input are valid revision, and failed to take into account
   that the user may want to give an annotated tag instead of a
   commit, which has been corrected.
   (merge 610e2b9240 jc/blame-ignore-fix later to maint).

 * "shit bisect start X Y", when X and Y are not valid committish
   object names, should take X and Y as pathspec, but didn't.
   (merge 73c6de06af cc/bisect-start-fix later to maint).

 * The explanation of the "scissors line" has been clarified.
   (merge 287416dba6 eg/mailinfo-doc-scissors later to maint).

 * A race that leads to an access to a free'd data was corrected in
   the codepath that reads pack files.
   (merge bda959c476 mt/delta-base-cache-races later to maint).

 * in_merge_bases_many(), a way to see if a commit is reachable from
   any commit in a set of commits, was totally broken when the
   commit-graph feature was in use, which has been corrected.
   (merge 8791bf1841 ds/in-merge-bases-many-optim-bug later to maint).

 * "shit submodule update --quiet" did not squelch underlying "rebase"
   and "poop" commands.
   (merge 3ad0401e9e td/submodule-update-quiet later to maint).

 * The lazy fetching done internally to make missing objects available
   in a partial clone incorrectly made permanent damage to the partial
   clone filter in the repository, which has been corrected.

 * "log -c --find-object=X" did not work well to find a merge that
   involves a change to an object X from only one parent.
   (merge 957876f17d jk/diff-cc-oidfind-fix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
