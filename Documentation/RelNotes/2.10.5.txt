shit v2.10.5 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.10.4
-------------------

 * "shit cvsserver" no longer is invoked by "shit daemon" by default,
   as it is old and largely unmaintained.

 * Various Perl scripts did not use safe_pipe_capture() instead of
   backticks, leaving them susceptible to end-user input.  They have
   been corrected.

Credits go to joernchen <joernchen@phenoelit.de> for finding the
unsafe constructs in "shit cvsserver", and to Jeff King at shitHub for
finding and fixing instances of the same issue in other scripts.
