shit v1.6.0.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.0
------------------

* "shit diff --cc" did not honor content mangling specified by
  shitattributes and core.autocrlf when reading from the work tree.

* "shit diff --check" incorrectly detected new trailing blank lines when
  whitespace check was in effect.

* "shit for-each-ref" tried to dereference NULL when asked for '%(body)" on
  a tag with a single incomplete line as its payload.

* "shit format-patch" peeked before the beginning of a string when
  "format.headers" variable is empty (a misconfiguration).

* "shit help help" did not work correctly.

* "shit mailinfo" (hence "shit am") was unhappy when MIME multipart message
  contained garbage after the finishing boundary.

* "shit mailinfo" also was unhappy when the "From: " line only had a bare
  e-mail address.

* "shit merge" did not refresh the index correctly when a merge resulted in
  a fast-forward.

* "shit merge" did not resolve a truly trivial merges that can be done
  without content level merges.

* "shit svn dcommit" to a repository with URL that has embedded usernames
  did not work correctly.
