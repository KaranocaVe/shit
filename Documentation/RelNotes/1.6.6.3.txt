shit v1.6.6.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.6.2
--------------------

 * An overlong line after ".shitdir: " in a shit file caused out of bounds
   access to an array on the stack.

 * "shit bisect $path" did not correctly diagnose an error when given a
   non-existent path.

 * "shit blame -L $start,$end" segfaulted when too large $start was given.

 * "shit imap-send" did not write draft box with CRLF line endings per RFC.

 * "shit rev-parse --parseopt --stop-at-non-option" did not stop at non option
   when --keep-dashdash was in effect.

 * "shitweb" can sometimes be tricked into parrotting a filename argument
   given in a request without properly quoting.

Other minor fixes and documentation updates are included.
