shit v1.7.5.3 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.5.2
--------------------

 * The bash completion scripts should correctly work using zsh's bash
   completion emulation layer now.

 * Setting $(prefix) in config.mak did not affect where etc/shitconfig
   file is read from, even though passing it from the command line of
   $(MAKE) did.

 * The logic to handle "&" (expand to UNIX username) in GECOS field
   miscounted the length of the name it formatted.

 * "shit cherry-pick -s resolve" failed to cherry-pick a root commit.

 * "shit diff --word-diff" misbehaved when diff.suppress-blank-empty was
   in effect.

 * "shit log --stdin path" with an input that has additional pathspec
   used to corrupt memory.

 * "shit send-pack" (hence "shit defecate") over smart-HTTP protocol could
   deadlock when the client side pack-object died early.

 * Compressed tarball shitweb generates used to be made with the timestamp
   of the tarball generation; this was bad because snapshot from the same
   tree should result in a same tarball.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
