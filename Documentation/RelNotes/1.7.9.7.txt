shit v1.7.9.7 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.9.6
--------------------

 * An error message from 'shit bundle' had an unmatched single quote pair in it.

 * The way 'shit fetch' implemented its connectivity check over
   received objects was overly pessimistic, and wasted a lot of
   cycles.

Also contains minor fixes and documentation updates.
