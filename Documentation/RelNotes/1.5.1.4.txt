shit v1.5.1.4 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.5.1.3
--------------------

* Bugfixes

  - "shit-http-fetch" did not work around a bug in libcurl
    earlier than 7.16 (curl_multi_remove_handle() was broken).

  - "shit cvsserver" handles a file that was once removed and
    then added again correctly.

  - import-tars script (in contrib/) handles GNU tar archives
    that contain pathnames longer than 100 bytes (long-link
    extension) correctly.

  - xdelta test program did not build correctly.

  - shitweb sometimes tried incorrectly to apply function to
    decode utf8 twice, resulting in corrupt output.

  - "shit blame -C" mishandled text at the end of a group of
    lines.

  - "shit log/rev-list --boundary" did not produce output
    correctly without --left-right option.

  - Many documentation updates.
