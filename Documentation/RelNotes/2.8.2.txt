shit v2.8.2 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.8.1
------------------

 * The embedded args argv-array in the child process is used to build
   the command line to run pack-objects instead of using a separate
   array of strings.

 * Bunch of tests on "shit clone" has been renumbered for better
   organization.

 * The tests that involve running httpd leaked the system-wide
   configuration in /etc/shitconfig to the tested environment.

 * "index-pack --keep=<msg>" was broken since v2.1.0 timeframe.

 * "shit config --get-urlmatch", unlike other variants of the "shit
   config --get" family, did not signal error with its exit status
   when there was no matching configuration.

 * The "--local-env-vars" and "--resolve-shit-dir" options of "shit
   rev-parse" failed to work outside a repository when the command's
   option parsing was rewritten in 1.8.5 era.

 * Fetching of history by naming a commit object name directly didn't
   work across remote-curl transport.

 * A small memory leak in an error codepath has been plugged in xdiff
   code.

 * strbuf_getwholeline() did not NUL-terminate the buffer on certain
   corner cases in its error codepath.

 * The startup_info data, which records if we are working inside a
   repository (among other things), are now uniformly available to shit
   subcommand implementations, and shit avoids attempting to touch
   references when we are not in a repository.

 * "shit mergetool" did not work well with conflicts that both sides
   deleted.

 * "shit send-email" had trouble parsing alias file in mailrc format
   when lines in it had trailing whitespaces on them.

 * When "shit merge --squash" stopped due to conflict, the concluding
   "shit commit" failed to read in the SQUASH_MSG that shows the log
   messages from all the squashed commits.

 * "shit merge FETCH_HEAD" dereferenced NULL pointer when merging
   nothing into an unborn history (which is arguably unusual usage,
   which perhaps was the reason why nobody noticed it).

 * Build updates for MSVC.

 * "shit diff -M" used to work better when two originally identical
   files A and B got renamed to X/A and X/B by pairing A to X/A and B
   to X/B, but this was broken in the 2.0 timeframe.

 * "shit send-pack --all <there>" was broken when its command line
   option parsing was written in the 2.6 timeframe.

 * When running "shit blame $path" with unnormalized data in the index
   for the path, the data in the working tree was blamed, even though
   "shit add" would not have changed what is already in the index, due
   to "safe crlf" that disables the line-end conversion.  It has been
   corrected.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
