shit v2.30.7 Release Notes
=========================

This release addresses the security issues CVE-2022-41903 and
CVE-2022-23521.


Fixes since v2.30.6
-------------------

 * CVE-2022-41903:

   shit log has the ability to display commits using an arbitrary
   format with its --format specifiers. This functionality is also
   exposed to shit archive via the export-subst shitattribute.

   When processing the padding operators (e.g., %<(, %<|(, %>(,
   %>>(, or %><( ), an integer overflow can occur in
   pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit() where a size_t is improperly
   stored as an int, and then added as an offset to a subsequent
   memcpy() call.

   This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a
   command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., shit
   log --format=...). It may also be triggered indirectly through
   shit archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format
   specifiers inside of files within the repository during a shit
   archive.

   This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which
   may result in remote code execution.

* CVE-2022-23521:

    shitattributes are a mechanism to allow defining attributes for
    paths. These attributes can be defined by adding a `.shitattributes`
    file to the repository, which contains a set of file patterns and
    the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern.

    When parsing shitattributes, multiple integer overflows can occur
    when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of
    attributes for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute
    names are huge.

    These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.shitattributes` file
    that may be part of the commit history. shit silently splits lines
    longer than 2KB when parsing shitattributes from a file, but not when
    parsing them from the index. Consequentially, the failure mode
    depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index or
    both.

    This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes,
    which may result in remote code execution.

The proposed fixes have been polished and extended to cover additional
findings by Patrick Steinhardt of shitLab, with help from others on the
shit security mailing list.
