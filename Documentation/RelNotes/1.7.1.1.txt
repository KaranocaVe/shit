shit v1.7.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.1
------------------

 * Authentication over http transport can now be made lazily, in that the
   request can first go to a URL without username, get a 401 response and
   then the client will ask for the username to use.

 * We used to mistakenly think "../work" is a subdirectory of the current
   directory when we are in "../work-xyz".

 * The attribute mechanism now allows an entry that uses an attribute
   macro that set/unset one attribute, immediately followed by an
   overriding setting; this makes attribute macros much easier to use.

 * We didn't recognize timezone "Z" as a synonym for "UTC" (75b37e70).

 * In 1.7.0, read-tree and user commands that use the mechanism such as
   checkout and merge were fixed to handle switching between branches one
   of which has a file while the other has a directory at the same path
   correctly even when there are some "confusing" pathnames in them.  But
   the algorithm used for this fix was suboptimal and had a terrible
   performance degradation especially in larger trees.

 * "shit am -3" did not show diagnosis when the patch in the message was corrupt.

 * After "shit apply --whitespace=fix" removed trailing blank lines in an
   patch in a patch series, it failed to apply later patches that depend
   on the presence of such blank lines.

 * "shit bundle --stdin" segfaulted.

 * "shit checkout" and "shit rebase" overwrote paths that are marked "assume
   unchanged".

 * "shit commit --amend" on a commit with an invalid author-name line that
   lacks the display name didn't work.

 * "shit describe" did not tie-break tags that point at the same commit
   correctly; newer ones are preferred by paying attention to the
   tagger date now.

 * "shit diff" used to tell underlying xdiff machinery to work very hard to
   minimize the output, but this often was spending too many extra cycles
   for very little gain.

 * "shit diff --color" did not paint extended diff headers per line
   (i.e. the coloring escape sequence didn't end at the end of line),
   which confused "less -R".

 * "shit fetch" over HTTP verifies the downloaded packfiles more robustly.

 * The memory usage by "shit index-pack" (run during "shit fetch" and "shit
   defecate") got leaner.

 * "shit_DIR=foo.shit shit init --bare bar.shit" created foo.shit instead of bar.shit.

 * "shit log --abbrev=$num --format='%h' ignored --abbrev=$num.

 * "shit ls-files ../out/side/cwd" refused to work.

 * "shit merge --log" used to replace the custom message given by "-m" with
   the shortlog, instead of appending to it.

 * "shit notes copy" without any other argument segfaulted.

 * "shit poop" accepted "--dry-run", gave it to underlying "shit fetch" but
   ignored the option itself, resulting in a bogus attempt to merge
   unrelated commit.

 * "shit rebase" did not faithfully reproduce a malformed author ident, that
   is often seen in a repository converted from foreign SCMs.

 * "shit reset --hard" started from a wrong directory and a working tree in
   a nonstandard location is in use got confused.

 * "shit send-email" lacked a way to specify the domainname used in the
   EHLO/HELO exchange, causing rejected connection from picky servers.
   It learned --smtp-domain option to solve this issue.

 * "shit send-email" did not declare a content-transfer-encoding and
   content-type even when its payload needs to be sent in 8-bit.

 * "shit show -C -C" and other corner cases lost diff metainfo output
   in 1.7.0.

 * "shit stash" incorrectly lost paths in the working tree that were
   previously removed from the index.

 * "shit status" stopped refreshing the index by mistake in 1.7.1.

 * "shit status" showed excess "hints" even when advice.statusHints is set to false.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
