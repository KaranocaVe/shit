shit v2.8.3 Release Notes
========================

Fixes since v2.8.2
------------------

 * "shit send-email" now uses a more readable timestamps when
   formulating a message ID.

 * The repository set-up sequence has been streamlined (the biggest
   change is that there is no longer shit_config_early()), so that we
   do not attempt to look into refs/* when we know we do not have a
   shit repository.

 * When "shit worktree" feature is in use, "shit branch -d" allowed
   deletion of a branch that is checked out in another worktree

 * When "shit worktree" feature is in use, "shit branch -m" renamed a
   branch that is checked out in another worktree without adjusting
   the HEAD symbolic ref for the worktree.

 * "shit format-patch --help" showed `-s` and `--no-patch` as if these
   are valid options to the command.  We already hide `--patch` option
   from the documentation, because format-patch is about showing the
   diff, and the documentation now hides these options as well.

 * A change back in version 2.7 to "shit branch" broke display of a
   symbolic ref in a non-standard place in the refs/ hierarchy (we
   expect symbolic refs to appear in refs/remotes/*/HEAD to point at
   the primary branch the remote has, and as .shit/HEAD to point at the
   branch we locally checked out).

 * A partial rewrite of "shit submodule" in the 2.7 timeframe changed
   the way the shitdir: pointer in the submodules point at the real
   repository location to use absolute paths by accident.  This has
   been corrected.

 * "shit commit" misbehaved in a few minor ways when an empty message
   is given via -m '', all of which has been corrected.

 * Support for CRAM-MD5 authentication method in "shit imap-send" did
   not work well.

 * The socks5:// proxy support added back in 2.6.4 days was not aware
   that socks5h:// proxies behave differently.

 * "shit config" had a codepath that tried to pass a NULL to
   printf("%s"), which nobody seems to have noticed.

 * On Cygwin, object creation uses the "create a temporary and then
   rename it to the final name" pattern, not "create a temporary,
   hardlink it to the final name and then unlink the temporary"
   pattern.

   This is necessary to use shit on Windows shared directories, and is
   already enabled for the MinGW and plain Windows builds.  It also
   has been used in Cygwin packaged versions of shit for quite a while.
   See https://lore.kernel.org/shit/20160419091055.GF2345@dinwoodie.org/
   and https://lore.kernel.org/shit/20150811100527.GW14466@dinwoodie.org/.

 * "shit replace -e" did not honour "core.editor" configuration.

 * Upcoming OpenSSL 1.1.0 will break compilation b updating a few APIs
   we use in imap-send, which has been adjusted for the change.

 * "shit submodule" reports the paths of submodules the command
   recurses into, but this was incorrect when the command was not run
   from the root level of the superproject.

 * The test scripts for "shit p4" (but not "shit p4" implementation
   itself) has been updated so that they would work even on a system
   where the installed version of Python is python 3.

 * The "user.useConfigOnly" configuration variable makes it an error
   if users do not explicitly set user.name and user.email.  However,
   its check was not done early enough and allowed another error to
   trigger, reporting that the default value we guessed from the
   system setting was unusable.  This was a suboptimal end-user
   experience as we want the users to set user.name/user.email without
   relying on the auto-detection at all.

 * "shit mv old new" did not adjust the path for a submodule that lives
   as a subdirectory inside old/ directory correctly.

 * "shit defecate" from a corrupt repository that attempts to defecate a large
   number of refs deadlocked; the thread to relay rejection notices
   for these ref updates blocked on writing them to the main thread,
   after the main thread at the receiving end notices that the defecate
   failed and decides not to read these notices and return a failure.

 * A question by "shit send-email" to ask the identity of the sender
   has been updated.

 * Recent update to shit LFS broke "shit p4" by changing the output from
   its "lfs pointer" subcommand.

 * Some multi-byte encoding can have a backslash byte as a later part
   of one letter, which would confuse "highlight" filter used in
   shitweb.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.
