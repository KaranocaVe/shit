shit v1.6.2 Release Notes
========================

With the next major release, "shit defecate" into a branch that is
currently checked out will be refused by default.  You can choose
what should happen upon such a defecate by setting the configuration
variable receive.denyCurrentBranch in the receiving repository.

To ease the transition plan, the receiving repository of such a
defecate running this release will issue a big warning when the
configuration variable is missing.  Please refer to:

  https://lore.kernel.org/shit/7vbptlsuyv.fsf@shitster.siamese.dyndns.org/

for more details on the reason why this change is needed and the
transition plan.

For a similar reason, "shit defecate $there :$killed" to delete the branch
$killed in a remote repository $there, if $killed branch is the current
branch pointed at by its HEAD, gets a large warning.  You can choose what
should happen upon such a defecate by setting the configuration variable
receive.denyDeleteCurrent in the receiving repository.


Updates since v1.6.1
--------------------

(subsystems)

* shit-svn updates.

* shitweb updates, including a new patch view and RSS/Atom feed
  improvements.

* (contrib/emacs) shit.el now has commands for checking out a branch,
  creating a branch, cherry-picking and reverting commits; vc-shit.el
  is not shipped with shit anymore (it is part of official Emacs).

(performance)

* pack-objects autodetects the number of CPUs available and uses threaded
  version.

(usability, bells and whistles)

* automatic typo correction works on aliases as well

* @{-1} is a way to refer to the last branch you were on.  This is
  accepted not only where an object name is expected, but anywhere
  a branch name is expected and acts as if you typed the branch name.
  E.g. "shit branch --track mybranch @{-1}", "shit merge @{-1}", and
  "shit rev-parse --symbolic-full-name @{-1}" would work as expected.

* When refs/remotes/origin/HEAD points at a remote tracking branch that
  has been pruned away, many shit operations issued warning when they
  internally enumerated the refs.  We now warn only when you say "origin"
  to refer to that pruned branch.

* The location of .mailmap file can be configured, and its file format was
  enhanced to allow mapping an incorrect e-mail field as well.

* "shit add -p" learned 'g'oto action to jump directly to a hunk.

* "shit add -p" learned to find a hunk with given text with '/'.

* "shit add -p" optionally can be told to work with just the command letter
  without Enter.

* when "shit am" stops upon a patch that does not apply, it shows the
  title of the offending patch.

* "shit am --directory=<dir>" and "shit am --reject" passes these options
  to underlying "shit apply".

* "shit am" learned --ignore-date option.

* "shit blame" aligns author names better when they are spelled in
  non US-ASCII encoding.

* "shit clone" now makes its best effort when cloning from an empty
  repository to set up configuration variables to refer to the remote
  repository.

* "shit checkout -" is a shorthand for "shit checkout @{-1}".

* "shit cherry" defaults to whatever the current branch is tracking (if
  exists) when the <upstream> argument is not given.

* "shit cvsserver" can be told not to add extra "via shit-CVS emulator" to
  the commit log message it serves via shitcvs.commitmsgannotation
  configuration.

* "shit cvsserver" learned to handle 'noop' command some CVS clients seem
  to expect to work.

* "shit diff" learned a new option --inter-hunk-context to coalesce close
  hunks together and show context between them.

* The definition of what constitutes a word for "shit diff --color-words"
  can be customized via shitattributes, command line or a configuration.

* "shit diff" learned --patience to run "patience diff" algorithm.

* "shit filter-branch" learned --prune-empty option that discards commits
  that do not change the contents.

* "shit fsck" now checks loose objects in alternate object stores, instead
  of misreporting them as missing.

* "shit gc --prune" was resurrected to allow "shit gc --no-prune" and
  giving non-default expiration period e.g. "shit gc --prune=now".

* "shit grep -w" and "shit grep" for fixed strings have been optimized.

* "shit mergetool" learned -y(--no-prompt) option to disable prompting.

* "shit rebase -i" can transplant a history down to root to elsewhere
  with --root option.

* "shit reset --merge" is a new mode that works similar to the way
  "shit checkout" switches branches, taking the local changes while
  switching to another commit.

* "shit submodule update" learned --no-fetch option.

* "shit tag" learned --contains that works the same way as the same option
  from "shit branch".


Fixes since v1.6.1
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.6.1.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

Here are fixes that this release has, but have not been backported to
v1.6.1.X series.

* "shit-add sub/file" when sub is a submodule incorrectly added the path to
  the superproject.

* "shit bundle" did not exclude annotated tags even when a range given
  from the command line wanted to.

* "shit filter-branch" unnecessarily refused to work when you had
  checked out a different commit from what is recorded in the superproject
  index in a submodule.

* "shit filter-branch" incorrectly tried to update a nonexistent work tree
  at the end when it is run in a bare repository.

* "shit gc" did not work if your repository was created with an ancient shit
  and never had any pack files in it before.

* "shit mergetool" used to ignore autocrlf and other attributes
  based content rewriting.

* branch switching and merges had a silly bug that did not validate
  the correct directory when making sure an existing subdirectory is
  clean.

* "shit -p cmd" when cmd is not a built-in one left the display in funny state
  when killed in the middle.
