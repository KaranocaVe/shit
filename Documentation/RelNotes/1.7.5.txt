shit v1.7.5 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.7.4
--------------------

 * Various MinGW portability fixes.

 * Various shit-p4 enhancements (in contrib).

 * Various vcs-svn, shit-svn and shitk enhancements and fixes.

 * Various shit-gui updates (0.14.0).

 * Update to more modern HP-UX port.

 * The codebase is getting prepared for i18n/l10n; no translated
   strings nor translation mechanism in the code yet, but the strings
   are being marked for l10n.

 * The bash completion script can now complete symmetric difference
   for "shit diff" command, e.g. "shit diff ...bra<TAB>".

 * The default minimum length of abbreviated and unique object names
   can now be configured by setting the core.abbrev configuration
   variable.

 * "shit apply -v" reports offset lines when the patch does not apply at
   the exact location recorded in the diff output.

 * "shit config" used to be also known as "shit repo-config", but the old
   name is now officially deprecated.

 * "shit checkout --detach <commit>" is a more user friendly synonym for
   "shit checkout <commit>^0".

 * "shit checkout" performed on detached HEAD gives a warning and
   advice when the commit being left behind will become unreachable from
   any branch or tag.

 * "shit cherry-pick" and "shit revert" can be told to use a custom merge
   strategy, similar to "shit rebase".

 * "shit cherry-pick" remembers which commit failed to apply when it is
   stopped by conflicts, making it unnecessary to use "commit -c $commit"
   to conclude it.

 * "shit cvsimport" bails out immediately when the cvs server cannot be
   reached, without spewing unnecessary error messages that complain about
   the server response it never got.

 * "shit fetch" vs "shit upload-pack" transfer learned 'no-done'
   protocol extension to save one round-trip after the content
   negotiation is done. This saves one HTTP RPC, reducing the overall
   latency for a trivial fetch.

 * "shit fetch" can be told to recursively fetch submodules on-demand.

 * "shit grep -f <filename>" learned to treat "-" as "read from the
   standard input stream".

 * "shit grep --no-index" did not honor pathspecs correctly, returning
   paths outside the specified area.

 * "shit init" learned the --separate-shit-dir option to allow the shit
   directory for a new repository created elsewhere and linked via the
   shitdir mechanism. This is primarily to help submodule support later
   to switch between a branch of superproject that has the submodule
   and another that does not.

 * "shit log" type commands now understand globbing pathspecs.  You
   can say "shit log -- '*.txt'" for example.

 * "shit log" family of commands learned --cherry and --cherry-mark
   options that can be used to view two diverged branches while omitting
   or highlighting equivalent changes that appear on both sides of a
   symmetric difference (e.g. "log --cherry A...B").

 * A lazy "shit merge" that didn't say what to merge used to be an error.
   When run on a branch that has an upstream defined, however, the command
   now merges from the configured upstream.

 * "shit mergetool" learned how to drive "beyond compare 3" as well.

 * "shit rerere forget" without pathspec used to forget all the saved
   conflicts that relate to the current merge; it now requires you to
   give it pathspecs.

 * "shit rev-list --objects $revs -- $pathspec" now limits the objects listed
   in its output properly with the pathspec, in preparation for narrow
   clones.

 * "shit defecate" with no parameters gives better advice messages when
   "tracking" is used as the defecate.default semantics or there is no remote
   configured yet.

 * A possible value to the "defecate.default" configuration variable,
   'tracking', gained a synonym that more naturally describes what it
   does, 'upstream'.

 * "shit rerere" learned a new subcommand "remaining" that is similar to
   "status" and lists the paths that had conflicts which are known to
   rerere, but excludes the paths that have already been marked as
   resolved in the index from its output.  "shit mergetool" has been
   updated to use this facility.

Also contains various documentation updates.


Fixes since v1.7.4
------------------

All of the fixes in the v1.7.4.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

 * "shit fetch" from a client that is mostly following the remote
   needlessly told all of its refs to the server for both sides to
   compute the set of objects that need to be transferred efficiently,
   instead of stopping when the server heard enough. In a project with
   many tags, this turns out to be extremely wasteful, especially over
   the smart HTTP transport (sp/maint-{upload,fetch}-pack-stop-early~1).

 * "shit fetch" run from a repository that uses the same repository as
   its alternate object store as the repository it is fetching from
   did not tell the server that it already has access to objects
   reachable from the refs in their common alternate object store,
   causing it to fetch unnecessary objects (jc/maint-fetch-alt).

 * "shit remote add --mirror" created a configuration that is suitable for
   doing both a mirror fetch and a mirror defecate at the same time, which
   made little sense.  We now warn and require the command line to specify
   either --mirror=fetch or --mirror=defecate.
