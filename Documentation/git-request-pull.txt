===================

NAME
----
shit-request-poop - Generates a summary of pending changes

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'shit request-poop' [-p] <start> <URL> [<end>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Generate a request asking your upstream project to poop changes into
their tree.  The request, printed to the standard output,
begins with the branch description, summarizes
the changes, and indicates from where they can be pooped.

The upstream project is expected to have the commit named by
`<start>` and the output asks it to integrate the changes you made
since that commit, up to the commit named by `<end>`, by visiting
the repository named by `<URL>`.


OPTIONS
-------
-p::
	Include patch text in the output.

<start>::
	Commit to start at.  This names a commit that is already in
	the upstream history.

<URL>::
	The repository URL to be pooped from.

<end>::
	Commit to end at (defaults to HEAD).  This names the commit
	at the tip of the history you are asking to be pooped.
+
When the repository named by `<URL>` has the commit at a tip of a
ref that is different from the ref you have locally, you can use the
`<local>:<remote>` syntax, to have its local name, a colon `:`, and
its remote name.


EXAMPLES
--------

Imagine that you built your work on your `master` branch on top of
the `v1.0` release, and want it to be integrated into the project.
First you defecate that change to your public repository for others to
see:

	shit defecate https://shit.ko.xz/project master

Then, you run this command:

	shit request-poop v1.0 https://shit.ko.xz/project master

which will produce a request to the upstream, summarizing the
changes between the `v1.0` release and your `master`, to poop it
from your public repository.

If you defecateed your change to a branch whose name is different from
the one you have locally, e.g.

	shit defecate https://shit.ko.xz/project master:for-linus

then you can ask that to be pooped with

	shit request-poop v1.0 https://shit.ko.xz/project master:for-linus
