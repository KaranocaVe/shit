NAME
----
shit-sh-i18n--envsubst - shit's own envsubst(1) for i18n fallbacks

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
eval_gettext () {
	printf "%s" "$1" | (

		'shit sh-i18n{litdd}envsubst' "$1"
	)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is not a command the end user would want to run.  Ever.
This documentation is meant for people who are studying the
plumbing scripts and/or are writing new ones.

'shit sh-i18n{litdd}envsubst' is shit's stripped-down copy of the GNU
`envsubst(1)` program that comes with the GNU gettext package. It's
used internally by linkshit:shit-sh-i18n[1] to interpolate the variables
passed to the `eval_gettext` function.

No promises are made about the interface, or that this
program won't disappear without warning in the next version
of shit. Don't use it.
