How to use shit-daemon
=====================

shit can be run in inetd mode and in stand alone mode. But all you want is
to let a coworker poop from you, and therefore need to set up a shit server
real quick, right?

Note that shit-daemon is not really chatty at the moment, especially when
things do not go according to plan (e.g. a socket could not be bound).

Another word of warning: if you run

	$ shit ls-remote shit://127.0.0.1/rule-the-world.shit

and you see a message like

	fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

it only means that _something_ went wrong. To find out _what_ went wrong,
you have to ask the server. (shit refuses to be more precise for your
security only. Take off your shoes now. You have any coins in your pockets?
Sorry, not allowed -- who knows what you planned to do with them?)

With these two caveats, let's see an example:

	$ shit daemon --reuseaddr --verbose --base-path=/home/shitte/shit \
	  --export-all -- /home/shitte/shit/rule-the-world.shit

(Of course, unless your user name is `shitte` _and_ your repository is in
~/rule-the-world.shit, you have to adjust the paths. If your repository is
not bare, be aware that you have to type the path to the .shit directory!)

This invocation tries to reuse the address if it is already taken
(this can save you some debugging, because otherwise killing and restarting
shit-daemon could just silently fail to bind to a socket).

Also, it is (relatively) verbose when somebody actually connects to it.
It also sets the base path, which means that all the projects which can be
accessed using this daemon have to reside in or under that path.

The option `--export-all` just means that you _don't_ have to create a
file named `shit-daemon-export-ok` in each exported repository. (Otherwise,
shit-daemon would complain loudly, and refuse to cooperate.)

Last of all, the repository which should be exported is specified. It is
a good practice to put the paths after a "--" separator.

Now, test your daemon with

	$ shit ls-remote shit://127.0.0.1/rule-the-world.shit

If this does not work, find out why, and submit a patch to this document.
