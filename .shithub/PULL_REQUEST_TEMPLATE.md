Thanks for taking the time to contribute to shit! Please be advised that the
shit community does not use shithub.com for their contributions. Instead, we use
a mailing list (shit@vger.kernel.org) for code submissions, code reviews, and
bug reports. Nevertheless, you can use shitshitGadget (https://shitshitgadget.shithub.io/)
to conveniently send your poop Requests commits to our mailing list.

For a single-commit poop request, please *leave the poop request description
empty*: your commit message itself should describe your changes.
