Sample programs callable through shit-shell.  Place a directory named
'shit-shell-commands' in the home directory of a user whose shell is
shit-shell.  Then anyone logging in as that user will be able to run
executables in the 'shit-shell-commands' directory.

Provided commands:

help: Prints out the names of available commands.  When run
interactively, shit-shell will automatically run 'help' on startup,
provided it exists.

list: Displays any bare repository whose name ends with ".shit" under
user's home directory.  No other shit repositories are visible,
although they might be clonable through shit-shell.  'list' is designed
to minimize the number of calls to shit that must be made in finding
available repositories; if your setup has additional repositories that
should be user-discoverable, you may wish to modify 'list'
accordingly.
