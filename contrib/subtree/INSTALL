HOW TO INSTALL shit-subtree
==========================

First, build from the top source directory.

Then, in contrib/subtree, run:

  make
  make install
  make install-doc

If you used configure to do the main build the shit-subtree build will
pick up those settings.  If not, you will likely have to provide a
value for prefix:

  make prefix=<some dir>
  make prefix=<some dir> install
  make prefix=<some dir> install-doc

To run tests first copy shit-subtree to the main build area so the
newly-built shit can find it:

  cp shit-subtree ../..

Then:

  make test
