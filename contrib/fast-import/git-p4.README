The shit-p4 script moved to the top-level of the shit source directory.

Invoke it as any other shit command, like "shit p4 clone", for instance.

Note that the top-level shit-p4.py script is now the source.  It is
built using make to shit-p4, which will be installed.

Windows users can copy the shit-p4.py source script directly, possibly
invoking it through a batch file called "shit-p4.bat" in the same folder.
It should contain just one line:

    @python "%~d0%~p0shit-p4.py" %*
