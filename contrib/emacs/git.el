(error "shit.el no longer ships with shit. It's recommended to
replace its use with Mashit, or simply delete references to shit.el
in your initialization file(s). See contrib/emacs/README in shit's
sources (https://shithub.com/shit/shit/blob/master/contrib/emacs/README)
for suggested alternatives and for why this happened. Emacs's own
VC mode and Mashit are viable alternatives.")
